I know its hills and valleys and the things that live there better than I know my motherâs face. What that creature may have been, I cannot say. But I can tell you one thing for certain, my friend. It wasnât any deer.â</p><p>- Allendon Mayersiel, ranger of Gillshire</p></blockquote><p></p><h3>All creatures dream. From the snakes slithering their way through the underbrush, to the owls roosted high in the hollows of maple trees, to the squirrels that get caught by either somewhere in between. The particulars that make up the wild dreamscapes that these beasts roam are unknown to most, but itâs their nightmares that mortals must be wary of. When the creatures of the woods touch that dread plane in unison, in the face of a threat to them all, the nightmares they produce can be made flesh and bone. Nightmares that almost reflect their own kind. Nightmares like the not deer.</h3><p></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Ophciphael, the Plane of Nightmares</span></strong></span></p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">In the cosmology of Quaseloth, the Underground Oracle campaign setting, Ophciphael is a shifting plane of nightmares created when a vengeful celestial being destroyed itself to punish the sins of mortals.</span></span></p></blockquote><p></p><h2><strong>Unnatural Response</strong></h2><p>Not deer are denizens of Ophciphael, the Plane of Nightmares. Created by the coalesced fear and mental anguish of groups of creatures crying out together in their dreams, these monstrous beings are an unnatural response to equally unnatural threats faced by the forest. Arcane disasters blighting the land, clearcutting and razing to make way for the progress of humanity, stygian energies oozing from a tear in the planes that corrupts the natural order. Any of these events could give rise to a not deer. Although given form on Ophciphael, not deer cannot physically manifest on the Prime Material without first being born. Entering the womb of a pregnant doe through the dreams of her unborn, the not deer waits, slowly draining the life from one of the unfortunate fawns within and eventually taking its place alongside its sibling. The resulting labor is a bloody and loathsome affair that encapsulates the trauma and turmoil that gave the creature its very essence. After its true birth, the not deer rises from the gore-slicked ground on too-steady legs with too many joints and takes its place among its new family. Despite their wholly unnatural and unsettling presence, the creatures the not deer surrounds themselves with do not appear to notice or care about their newest herd memberâs physical or behavioral irregularities. Like all nightmares, the not deer is an inherently insidious creature, able to twist and manipulate the perceptions of those around it so only the most enchanted beast or earthen creature would be able to discern its true nature. The not deer assumes an adult form overnight and, after driving any competing bucks or predators in the area to destroy themselves in fits of froth-spitting rage and frenzy, takes its place at the center of the herd. And it begins to feed.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Fear Eater</strong></h2><p>Not deer consume the psychic energy of living creatures around them, siphoning their discomfort, fear, and pain to sustain themselves. Although the beasts of the forest offer little in the way of intelligence, in large enough numbers, the not deer can still gorge itself without fully depleting its food source. Perfectly willing to disrupt the natural order, the not deer will lead its herd into disease, famine, and catastrophe so that it might enjoy a heartier meal while remaining careful not to let the bulk of its resources succumb to their circumstances. Not deer will even go so far as to assist in whatever disaster created it if itâs able, or at the very least, keep anyone from attempting to remedy the situation. When faced with an intelligent threat, the not deer will employ the same mind-clouding methods and eldritch subterfuge it does on the beasts around it, but instead of savoring this new meal it will seek to fully consume and destroy the mind of its foe as soon as is possible. Unwilling to let its presence be known for risk of being ejected from the plane, the not deer will use every tool in its nightmarish arsenal to protect itself and destroy its enemies, including calling on its false family to defy their instincts and viciously attack its adversaries.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Harvestable Materials:</strong> <em>@UUID[Item.yJv3c49Te8sya8ef]{Not Deer
