From the shambling corpses risen from their graves to the bloodthirsty prowlers of rooftops and alleyways, those creatures cursed to roam long after their hearts have stopped beating are the bane of all living things. Too often, though, the most insidious of these undead are allowed to tread the realms of mortals unnoticed, slipping through man-made barriers to torment the minds and hearts of those within. It is truly a blessing that the Veil Watchmen have dedicated themselves to protecting the veil that separates specters and men.</p><p>Where other rangers concern themselves with guarding humanity against the natural realms, Veil Watchmen have tasked themselves with protecting mortal souls from incorporeal spirits. Although their earthen magics are often effective in the pursuit of their incorporeal foes, a Veil Watchman will utilize any tools and techniques necessary to safeguard mortals. Alchemy, divine blessings, esoteric tomes, and arcane artifacts—attained legally or illicitly—are all equal parts of their ghost hunting arsenal. This willingness to experiment leads them to ally themselves with an assortment of churches, secret societies, and guilds.
