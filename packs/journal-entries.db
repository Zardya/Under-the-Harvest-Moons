Before I could ask why two children were traveling alone at night, their begging turned to screams, then to howling and pounding on the gates. I felt the ramparts shaking under my feet as I turned to sound the alarm. When I looked back, they were gone as suddenly as they’d appeared.”</p><p>~ From the report of Falen Cooper, wall guard</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Black-eyed children are widely regarded as a myth. A tale told by road-weary travelers to entertain tavern goers and encourage the flow of free ale. But these child-like fiends are all too real and spend their lives roaming roads and paths in search of well-meaning people to fall prey to their insidious guise.</p><p></p><blockquote><p>Our <a href=\"https://undergroundoracle.com/tag/monsters-mythica/\">Monsters Mythica</a> series provides reimagined monsters from myth and urban legends as 5e-compatible creatures ready for your fantasy setting.</p></blockquote><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/black_eye_child.png\" width=\"116\" height=\"256\" /><p></p><h2><strong>Kind Spirits, Delicious Hearts</strong></h2><p>Black-Eyed Children are the embodiment of treachery and vile trickery, assuming the form of innocent children in need of rescue in order to consume the spiritual energies and, eventually, the flesh of those good enough to offer them help. Once the children have successfully ensnared their victim, they will slowly drain them of their essence until they’re too weak to fight off their needle-like teeth and claws.</p><p>There have been stories of entire caravans slowly succumbing to and being ravaged by groups of black-eyed children, and these bloody tales have been so effective in certain parts of the continent that it’s seen as bad luck to help lone children on the road. While those stories have been sufficient in deterring those with more hardened hearts, it’s done nothing to stop the soft hearts the children are hunting for.</p><h2><strong>Problem Children</strong></h2><p>Although they can be found alone, black-eyed children are normally summoned in pairs and prefer to travel in small groups of four or five. Given their incredibly chaotic and bloodthirsty natures, black-eyed children are one of the least reliable demons to summon, using any tricks or avenues available to them to break free from their masters and run rampant on the Prime Material. While on the Lower Planes, black-eyed children spend their time plotting and searching for ways to get to the Prime Material. Since they’re rarely summoned outright, they generally accomplish this through assisting greater demons and devils in their schemes, finding gates or portals, and taking advantage of the mistakes of naive or inexperienced cultists.</p><p></p><p>@UUID[Actor.MmH2oVwHg9fP4kNp]{Black-eyed Child}</p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/byc_statblock.png\" />","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Monsters Mythica: Dread Coachman","type":"text","_id":"9Dy5Nzc0o2NFnxPa","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>@UUID[Actor.V1uPutZd3SDbs09D]{Dread Coachman}</p><p></p><blockquote><p>“Have I been cursed? Once again I was upon the ramparts on Pallowen, and once again, the gods granted me a terrible vision. I was doing my patrols when the air grew so chill I thought I would freeze in my armor. Suddenly I heard a terrible racket from above and looked up to see a carriage, pulled by spectral horses and driven by a coachman so horrible I thought my heart would seize up. I watched as he passed over one of my fellow guards and pulled him into his wretched cart before vanishing into the night sky. I will never forget it. And I will certainly be switching shifts next year.”</p><p>- From the report of Falen Cooper, wall guard</p></blockquote><p></p><p>The crack of a whip. The terrible clattering of hooves cutting through the still night air. The ghastly inevitability of what this creature of retribution carries with it in its loathsome carriage. These are the details of stories whispered by cutthroats in back alleys and by bandits around their campfires. Tales of punishment for crimes left unanswered and of victims left unavenged. Beware, they say, with their eyes turned toward the starless sky and what it holds beyond its borders. Beware the dread coachman.</p><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/dread_coachman2.png\" /><p></p><h2><strong>Soul Collector</strong></h2><p>A dread coachman, or collector of souls as it’s called in some regions around the continent, is not only a harbinger of death but of eternal punishment. Sent from beyond the realms of mortal men to bring retribution from vengeful gods or otherworldly beings, once a dread coachman has been tasked with a bounty, they cannot return to their masters empty-handed. There is no stretch of the Prime Material that their victims could go where the dread coachman would not find them. Once they have discovered their target, they make their intentions known by calling out their name and their crimes in a voice that resonates within the chests of all who can hear it. After that, it’s only a matter of time before they're within the dark oblivion of the dread coachman’s carriage, never to be seen again.</p><p>Not even death can dissuade the dread coachman, as it’s sometimes sent to gather lost souls wandering through the planes to bring them in for their final judgments, especially those that led dark lives and have failed to move on to their gods.</p><p>Through the popularity of the folklore surrounding it, this particular wraith has gained a reputation for bringing evil men to meet their ultimate justice, but the truth is a far grimmer matter. The dread coachman is an amoral creature, only capable of carrying out the acts of revenge directed to it by its master, whether those commands are truly just or not. Villain or hero, guilty or innocent, once their taskmaster has delivered their judgment, the dread coachman can only obey.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Broken Bonds</strong></h2><p>The dread coachman’s imprisonment to the whims of their master begins at their creation, which occurs when the follower or servant of a god or other immortal betrays their sacred covenant. Regardless of whether the betrayal was purposeful or inadvertent, the punishment is the same; an infinity of horrid servitude.</p><p>There are rare circumstances when the bonds between a dread coachman and their commander are severed, usually through planar events or powerful artifactual magic. When this happens, the creature begins to rot and is driven entirely into darkness, harvesting as many souls as it can and growing in power and maliciousness until it is finally driven from the plane. Or, in the worst instances, until it is bound to a more nefarious source on the Prime Material.</p><p></p><section id=\"secret-ac3hMr3R0dhGAylm\" class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM NOTES: WHIP OF SORROWS</strong></p><p>When a dread coachman is defeated, they’re driven back to their plane of origin, leaving behind their primary weapon, the whip of all sorrows.</p><p>@UUID[Item.u5r4IJerJxl91gsz]{Whip of All Sorrows}</p><p><strong>Whip of All Sorrows</strong></p><p>Weapon (Whip), Rare (Requires Attunement)</p><p>This ghoulish whip is made from the polished bones of a multitude of different humanoids and ends in a cruel barb.</p><p>While attuned to this whip, you have resistance to necrotic damage, and this weapon does an additional 2d8 necrotic damage.</p></section><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/dread_coachman.png\" /><p></p><h2><strong>Plot Hooks</strong></h2><p>The following are plot hooks you can use to introduce or interact with this new creature:</p><p>• “Call the guards! The bloody coachman is here for me, and I’ve done nothing wrong!” As the dread coachman passes through the house the woman ran out of, cold air hits you, and the smell of putrid death comes along with it.</p><p>• You’re stopped by the local sheriff as you pass her building. She tells you that she’s noticed how you hold yourself and how well-armed you are and says she’s looking for assistance. “A flying carriage has been seen over the past few weeks, and each time it’s reported, people come up missing. Could you help us find out what’s happening?”.</p><p>• As you’re walking down the road, you suddenly hear your name being called out. It echoes in the air and reverberates through your chest. “Your name has been given, and I have come to collect your soul!”</p><p>• After traveling through the mountains for some time, you come upon a strange carriage with a missing wheel. From behind it, a voice calls out, “Do not fear me, for I have not come for you. The one I seek has done much evil against both humanity and the gods.” A hideous coachman steps from behind the carriage and continues speaking. “But I could use your assistance.”</p><p>• As you stop in the city, you see a post that reads, “Only the brave should apply. Saviors needed to face and defeat a ghastly magical creature. It and its carriage have somehow been trapped inside old farmer MiCallan’s barn outside of town. All previous attempts to destroy it have failed. Upon completion of this mission, the heroes would receive our eternal gratitude and much gratuity. Report to Governor Ernistall at the courthouse with interest.”</p><p></p><p>@UUID[Actor.V1uPutZd3SDbs09D]{Dread Coachman}</p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/dread_coachman_statblock.png\" /><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Monsters Mythica: Terrors of the Deep Woods - Bunny Man","type":"text","_id":"JL15BnLKLqipsetq","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>There are woods so deep and so dark they mirror the ocean in their mystery and grandeur.

They are revenants seeking themselves. Tasked to roam the unhallowed woods, forever seeking their own kin.”</p><p>~ Egress Varn, High Priest of the Eternal Ember Temple</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Tales of what punishments befall mortals who break the sanctity of enchanted lands are plentiful. Hunters who mark a sacred beast as their prey. Woodsmen who fell the wrong tree in a grove. Guardians of the earthen realms who fail their lords in their solemn duties. All must pay a price in order to prevent future transgressions from their kind. But none have paid so heavily as the ones they call the bunny men.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Cursed Guardians</strong></h2><p>Bunny men are hulking, malevolent creatures, cursed by fey or similar otherworldly beings for perceived trespasses against the flora and fauna within their domains. A cruel amalgam of hare and humanoid, bunny men are stripped of any mercy, benevolence, or reason that they once possessed and doomed to act as guardians in the lands that they offended, hunting down and eliminating anyone foolish or careless enough to wander into the territories they’ve been loosed upon.</p><p>Typically cursed and created by evil fey, bunny men are highly valued by deep woods hags and their adjacent ilk for both their bloodthirsty natures and ceaseless capabilities. Along with any thread of goodness that once remained in the wretched creatures, bunny men are deprived of their ability to sleep or rest, instead tasked with endlessly searching and surveying the lands of their masters for any potential threats or victims they might find there. A fell combination of finely-honed skill and bequeathed magics, bunny men are master hunters. Perfectly suited to force their way through any obstacle or hindrance set before them, once a bunny man has sighted their prey, they cannot stop their pursuit until either they or their target has been returned to the dark soil.</p><p>The bunny men’s tool of choice for their grim business is the same no matter what their long-forgotten origins may have been — a woodsmen’s axe, larger and sharper than any that they would have wielded in their past life and dripping with steady rivulets of blood that seep from the head of the weapon itself. It’s said that with every drop of blood that falls from their axe, another piece of who they once were is lost to the ether. Whether or not that is true, in the rare moments that a bunny man gains some small semblance of lucidity, it comes as more curse than blessing.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Bloodsoaked Relief</strong></h2><p>When a bunny man has achieved their singular goal, their axe slick with blood brought from outside of the woods they are forsaken to protect, they’re allowed a brief moment of bittersweet rest. Standing among the remains of the lives they snuffed out, their muscles go slack, their mind slows, and they lose themselves to whatever place these tortured and tortuous creatures go in these scarce moments. In this trance-like state, the bunny man remembers. Remembers who they once were, what events led them to their cursed shape and the many wicked things they have been charged to do since then. And, in the face of the infinite sadness of that tiny moment, they remember how to scream. It’s during this time that truly vicious and vengeful creators might visit their inconsolable warden, making promises of an eventual release from their curse and reinstatement of the life they lost before committing their terrible crimes against the earthen realm. These are, of course, lies and further cruelties that the bunny man will forget by sunrise. On the rare occasion that a bunny man has outlived their usefulness to their master, they are turned wholly into a hare. Fulfilling the fey’s darkest sense of humor and finally making the full transformation from predator to prey.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Harvestable Materials:</strong></h2><p></p><h3><strong>Bunny Man’s Axe</strong></h3><p>@UUID[Item.qYTqJsseiV0YyH35]{Bunny Man's Axe}</p><p><em><strong>Weapon (Greataxe), Rare (Requires Attunement)</strong></em></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p><p>When you roll a maximum result on the damage die for an attack you make with this axe, the target creature must make a Constitution saving throw whose DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.

If your attunement to this weapon is not removed by the next new moon, you will transform fully into a bunny man at full health and under the GM's control. Once you have made this transformation, only a wish spell or divine intervention can restore you to your former state.</p><p></p><p>@UUID[Actor.t07GGgf6ZSliFY76]{Bunny Man}</p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/bunnyman_axe.png\" />","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Monsters Mythica: Terrors of the Deep Woods - Not Deer","type":"text","_id":"dhfO5t5S2Rt9CHn1","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">There are woods so deep and so dark they mirror the ocean in their mystery and grandeur.

It wasn’t any deer.”</p><p>- Allendon Mayersiel, ranger of Gillshire</p></blockquote><p></p><p>All creatures dream. From the snakes slithering their way through the underbrush, to the owls roosted high in the hollows of maple trees, to the squirrels that get caught by either somewhere in between. The particulars that make up the wild dreamscapes that these beasts roam are unknown to most, but it’s their nightmares that mortals must be wary of. When the creatures of the woods touch that dread plane in unison, in the face of a threat to them all, the nightmares they produce can be made flesh and bone. Nightmares that almost reflect their own kind. Nightmares like the not deer.</p><p></p><section id=\"secret-gOx6Qvetxt17cxkj\" class=\"secret\"><p><em><strong>GM NOTES: OPHCIPHAEL, THE PLANE OF NIGHTMARES</strong></em></p><p>In the cosmology of Quaseloth, the Underground Oracle campaign setting, Ophciphael is a shifting plane of nightmares created when a vengeful celestial being destroyed itself to punish the sins of mortals.</p></section><p></p><h2><strong>Unnatural Response</strong></h2><p>Not deer are denizens of Ophciphael, the Plane of Nightmares. Created by the coalesced fear and mental anguish of groups of creatures crying out together in their dreams, these monstrous beings are an unnatural response to equally unnatural threats faced by the forest. Arcane disasters blighting the land, clearcutting and razing to make way for the progress of humanity, stygian energies oozing from a tear in the planes that corrupts the natural order. Any of these events could give rise to a not deer.</p><p>Although given form on Ophciphael, not deer cannot physically manifest on the Prime Material without first being born. Entering the womb of a pregnant doe through the dreams of her unborn, the not deer waits, slowly draining the life from one of the unfortunate fawns within and eventually taking its place alongside its sibling. The resulting labor is a bloody and loathsome affair that encapsulates the trauma and turmoil that gave the creature its very essence. After its true birth, the not deer rises from the gore-slicked ground on too-steady legs with too many joints and takes its place among its new family.</p><p>Despite their wholly unnatural and unsettling presence, the creatures the not deer surrounds themselves with do not appear to notice or care about their newest herd member’s physical or behavioral irregularities. Like all nightmares, the not deer is an inherently insidious creature, able to twist and manipulate the perceptions of those around it so only the most enchanted beast or earthen creature would be able to discern its true nature. The not deer assumes an adult form overnight and, after driving any competing bucks or predators in the area to destroy themselves in fits of froth-spitting rage and frenzy, takes its place at the center of the herd. And it begins to feed.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Fear Eater</strong></h2><p>Not deer consume the psychic energy of living creatures around them, siphoning their discomfort, fear, and pain to sustain themselves. Although the beasts of the forest offer little in the way of intelligence, in large enough numbers, the not deer can still gorge itself without fully depleting its food source. Perfectly willing to disrupt the natural order, the not deer will lead its herd into disease, famine, and catastrophe so that it might enjoy a heartier meal while remaining careful not to let the bulk of its resources succumb to their circumstances. Not deer will even go so far as to assist in whatever disaster created it if it’s able, or at the very least, keep anyone from attempting to remedy the situation.</p><p>When faced with an intelligent threat, the not deer will employ the same mind-clouding methods and eldritch subterfuge it does on the beasts around it, but instead of savoring this new meal it will seek to fully consume and destroy the mind of its foe as soon as is possible. Unwilling to let its presence be known for risk of being ejected from the plane, the not deer will use every tool in its nightmarish arsenal to protect itself and destroy its enemies, including calling on its false family to defy their instincts and viciously attack its adversaries.</p><p></p><h2 data-anchor=\"harvestable-materials:\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:1rem 0px 0.5rem;padding:0px;font-weight:normal;font-size:1.5em;border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header);color:rgb(25, 24, 19);font-family:Signika, sans-serif;font-style:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">Harvestable Materials:</strong></span></h2><p></p><h3><strong>Not Deer Antler</strong></h3><p>@UUID[Item.yJv3c49Te8sya8ef]{Not Deer Antler}</p><p>When it is destroyed, the not deer is shunted back to the Plane of Nightmares, leaving behind a rancid-smelling puddle of dark purple ooze and a single piece of antler.</p><p><em><strong>Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)</strong></em></p><p>This antler can be used as a spellcasting focus.

But where did I find myself on the evening? Guarding a caravan of wine and silks and praying to the gods I made it to morning. Those white devils trailed us for miles. Weaving in and out of the trees and vanishing from sight in a blink. Until the day I die, I’ll remember those howls. But not nearly as clearly as Jonathan’s screams as they drug him into the night.”</p><p>~ From the report of Falen Cooper, transport guard</p></blockquote><p></p><p>While traveling through the wilds or on vacant trails along towering woods, a noisy night can be a true blessing. The sounds of animals filling the air may be disconcerting to people better acquainted with life inside city walls than without, but for well-worn travelers, the sounds of nature are the sounds of normalcy. It’s the still nights that are truly terrifying. When the wind seems nervous to come as more than a whisper and the moonless sky hangs heavy and stifling overhead. It’s on those nights the true monsters are about, waiting to pierce that unnatural silence with their ragged, shrieking howls.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Monstrous Bloodline</strong></h2><p>White things resemble many-limbed wolves the size of bears. They roam far and wide through their wooded territories, perpetually trying to sate their nearly endless lust for rending and feasting on flesh and bone. Consummate killers, white things will gladly tear their way through herds of prey animals or even apex predators foolish enough to see the white things as nothing more than rival beasts. But although their environments are flush with creatures ripe for the picking, the white things are always drawn back to the source of their first taste of blood.</p><p>Before they were the terrible beings they are today, the first white things were a different sort of monster altogether. A small family of nobles known for their heavy-handed handling of the people under their banner and the battle￾hungry way they acquired new territory around their lands, they were as fierce as they were cold and cared only for those that shared their bloodline. They had been skirmishing for months with a small group of resistance fighters in the hills of their newest territory when the matriarch of the noble family had finally had enough. Leading the charge herself with her children beside her, they razed the hillside without any regard for the people there, eventually forcing the leaders of the resistance to turn themselves over in an attempt to stop the wanton violence.</p><p>As the leaders of the resistance stood bound on the gallows, the gloating matriarch allowed them to say their final words before sending them on to oblivion. The eldest of the resistance, a man whose back bent double under the weight of the years he carried, stepped forward and used his dying words to cry out a curse, begging his god to reveal these devil’s dogs as the monsters they truly were. And as the old man’s rope went taut, it punctuated his prayer with a sound like a thunderclap that was said to be heard for miles before settling into an unnatural silence. The air then filled with the shrieking howls of the matriarch and her noble family and the desperate cries of their men.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Silent Night</strong></h2><p>After tearing their soldiers to unrecognizable shreds, the white things abandoned their realm for woodlands that suited their new forms and hungers, spreading through the darkest woodlands over the centuries that followed and terrorizing travelers foolish enough to brave the night. When the moon is new, white things slip silently through the forest and along roadsides, fading in and out of the trees like a fog and trailing unsuspecting parties until the perfect time to strike.

As a woman runs by, she screams that there’s a rabbit monster hacking people apart!Animals in the area have been behaving strangely, attacking hunters and each other without regard to their natural instincts. The village elder needs someone to find out what’s causing this behavior before someone is seriously hurt.</p><p>• Progress has stopped on the construction of the king’s newest road, with the workers in the camp at the forest’s edge reporting terrible weakness and the inability to sleep due to terrifying nightmares.</p><p>• Local farmers report that some sort of fiend or ghost is tearing their livestock to shreds.

They could remember men and women, faces young and old running the gamut of expressions in their mind. They could even remember some of their names. Too many names. Was one of them theirs? How very curious, they thought.</p><p>Why had they never noticed these colors? So bright and so many in their shades and tones. Had there always been so many? And the scents, and the sounds, and the feeling of their feet on the ground. The feeling of their skin on their muscle on their bone. These they remembered, didn’t they? They tried to catch one of the chaotic memories skittering through their mind, something recalling all of these myriad sensations. But they came away from the rolling swarm of thoughts with only essences. Like a close friend describing a feeling rather than the feeling itself.</p><p>Friends. Those they remembered. Little sparks of light in a darkness so thick and clinging and intense that breaking free of it was like being born.</p><p>They would find their friends.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>The Plane of Nightmares is a labyrinthian miasma composed of the multitudes of fears and terrors of the creatures of the planes. From the panic of prey animals fleeing snapping jaws to the creeping dread of monarchs awaiting their assassin’s blades, when eyes close and minds float freely into the waiting black, the Plane of Nightmares is where they come ashore. It’s from this twisted realm of infinite and terrible possibility that the terrorborn emerge.</p><p>Strange beings made of a thousand coalesced fears and snatches of stolen memories, the terrorborn wander the Prime Material with an almost childlike curiosity, bearing witness to sights and sounds for the first time unfiltered by the fear of the dreaming. Some terrorborn understand their origins entirely and find themselves strangely delighted by their new form of existence. Others suffer in confusion, lost in the ill-fitting memories of an identity that was never meant to be theirs. In either case, the terrorborn often find themselves drawn to a life of adventure. Some seeking to experience every fresh new thing that corporeal life has to offer, while others are desperately chasing ghosts that cannot provide them with the answers they desire.</p><p></p><h1>Nightmare Ancestry</h1><p>Although the terrorborn are spawned from many fears, each one has a specific nightmare ancestry that makes up the core of their being. This ancestry not only impacts how they look when they reveal their nightmare form but may also impact how they act in the world. A terrorborn whose nightmare ancestry is related to spiders might constantly find themselves toying with the crawling insects and silently relishing the looks of disgust from those around them, while a terrorborn whose nightmare ancestry is taken from the fear of heights might spend their nights running along precarious rooftops.</p><p>When you select this lineage, choose one of the ancestries below to provide inspiration for your character and to determine which of the traits you gain in your lineage’s traits description.</p><p></p><section id=\"secret-6yEmMnpqoSmXen3W\" class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM NOTES: GUISE AND NIGHTMARE TRAITS</strong></p><p>Each of the nightmare ancestry options includes guise traits and nightmare traits. Guise traits indicate traits that your chosen humanoid form might have while on the Prime Material that hint at their strange origins. Nightmare traits are possible features that are revealed when you use the ability granted by your nightmare ancestry or when you are fully present on the Plane of Nightmares.</p><p>Players should be encouraged to take inspiration from the guise and nightmare traits provided to create their own unique and terrible visage.</p></section><p></p><h3>Heights</h3><p>You are crumbling cliff ledges and towering peaks. Free falls from unforgiving distances and careless slips from window sills. You are made from the dreams of those who fear heights more than anything else that the world has to offer, and as such, you cannot help but feel drawn to those same high places that are responsible for your emergence.</p><p><strong>Guise Traits:</strong> Tall, lanky, sharp features, high hairline.</p><p><strong>Nightmare Traits:</strong> Looming, extra joints, wind-blown garments, empty eye sockets.</p><p></p><h3>Pestilence</h3><p>You are sweating brow and retching stomach. Wounds turned septic, and eyes clouded by unchecked fever. You were born from the fear of disease and sickness witnessed by too many for too long. You are unphased by the presence of your origin and, instead, find yourself endlessly curious about how mortal bodies degenerate and decay.</p><p><strong>Guise Traits:</strong> Pallid, underweight, dark eye circles, wispy hair.</p><p><strong>Nightmare Traits:</strong> Gaunt, yellow eyes, plague masks, clouds of flies.</p><p></p><h3>Spiders</h3><p>You are clinging web and weeping fangs. Chittering mandibles and the predator’s gaze of far too many unblinking eyes. Your birth is tied to the terror inspired by arachnids, great and small. You find that you feel as at home among them as in any dining hall or tavern and never mind inviting one or two of your kin to any place you visit.</p><p><strong>Guise Traits:</strong> Long-limbed, large eyes, pronounced cuspids, coarse hair.</p><p><strong>Nightmare Traits:</strong> Many eyes, mandibles, spider legs, swarms of spiders.</p><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/thedark.png\" width=\"231\" height=\"326\" /><p></p><h3>The Dark</h3><p>You are endless void and crushing black. The haunting possibility of the waiting unseen and of nothing at all. You find your origins in the oldest of fears, of the darkness that hides unspeakable horrors or highlights unbearable emptiness. You wrap the blackest nights around yourself like a treasured cloak and find solace in places beyond the light’s reach.</p><p><strong>Guise Traits:</strong> Dark hair, grey pallor, black eyes, long shadow.</p><p><strong>Nightmare Traits:</strong> Featureless void, black tendrils, endless cloak, shifting size.</p><p></p><section id=\"secret-smRBSRuV4Jnp6P0o\" class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM NOTES: NEW CREATURE TYPE - NIGHTMARE</strong></p><p>The terrorborn (and the not deer featured later in this supplement) is an example of a new creature type present in the Underground Oracle campaign setting.

You are also considered a humanoid for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be a humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size.</strong> You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you choose this lineage.</p><p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 90 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.</p><p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><strong>Blood of Fear.</strong> You are made of fear, and yet you do not feel it. You are immune to being frightened.</p><p><strong>Material Guise.</strong> Choose a lineage that doesn’t have a fly speed or swimming speed. You look as though you are a natural member of the chosen lineage. You do not gain any traits provided by the selected lineage.</p><p><strong>Nightmare Ancestry.</strong> As you adventure and your spark grows, your connection to your nightmare ancestry manifests in more powerful ways. At 3rd level, you gain one of the following traits based on the ancestry you chose above. If your selected trait requires a creature to make a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your Proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. Once you’ve used this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. When you reach 10th level, you may use this trait twice before needing a long rest.</p><p><strong>Vertigo (Heights Ancestry).</strong> As an action, you trap your foe on the towering peaks that jut from their subconscious. Choose a target creature within 30 feet of you that can see you. The target creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or its speed is reduced to 0, and it is frightened for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus. The target creature may repeat its saving throw at the start of each of its turns or immediately after taking damage. Once a creature has succeeded on its saving throw, it is no longer frightened, and its speed returns to normal.</p><p><strong>Plague Touch (Pestilence Ancestry).</strong> As a bonus action, you brush your fingers across a creature within 5 feet of you that can see you and pull the sickness they fear to the surface. The target creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be frightened for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus. While frightened in this way, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to twice your proficiency bonus. The target creature may repeat its saving throw at the start of each of its turns or immediately after taking damage. Once a creature has succeeded on its saving throw, it is no longer frightened, and its hit point maximum returns to normal.</p><p><strong>Swarm (Spiders Ancestry).</strong> As an action, you summon a swarm of crawling horrors from the mind of your victim. Choose a target creature within 30 feet of you that can see you. The target creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be frightened for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus. While frightened in this way, when the target creature starts its turn, it takes psychic damage equal to twice your proficiency bonus. The target creature may repeat its saving throw at the start of each of its turns or immediately after taking damage from any source other than your illusionary swarm. Once a creature has succeeded on its saving throw, it is no longer frightened, and your illusionary swarm disappears.</p><p><strong>Envelop (The Dark Ancestry).</strong> As an action, you draw the darkness from the nightmares of your adversaries and close it tightly around them. Choose a number of creatures within 30 feet of you equal to your proficiency bonus that can see you. The target creatures must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or they are blinded and frightened for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus. Affected creatures are still considered frightened by you despite the fact that they cannot see you. The target creatures may repeat their saving throws at the start of each of their turns or immediately after taking damage. Once a creature has succeeded on its saving throw, it is no longer frightened or blinded.</p><p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common, and one other language you and your GM agree is appropriate.</p><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Bardic College: College of the Curse Caller","type":"text","_id":"Sa5cXdOLXIXlSIfk","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p></p><blockquote><p>“In our darkest hours, the universe gifts us each a glorious melody.

This is a time that inspires both fear and trepidation, but these tales will protect us from Old Scarwood and his ilk. So long as the terror rings true.”</p><p>- Traditional start to the Warding of Pallowen</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Pallowen, known in some areas of the continent as the Frightful Harvest, is a yearly festival celebrated in honor of the last day of autumn. It acknowledges the blessings gained throughout the year and the role that both good and evil play in people's lives. It is a time to give thanks, but more importantly, it is a day of warding. Warding against not only the darkness of the season to come but also the nefarious creatures and evil spirits empowered during this transitional season.</p><p></p><h2><strong>A Druid’s Sacrifice</strong></h2><p>There are two central figures of the Pallowen festival—Pallowen, the brave halfling druid the holiday is named for, and Old Scarwood, a dark and twisted tree creature full of rot and malice. As the legend goes, a thousand years ago, the specter of a blighted druid tormented the people of the countryside, poisoning their crops and corrupting their forests. After many people valiantly tried and failed to stop the wicked spirit, a humble halfling druid answered the call of the woodlands that depended on her.</p><p>Pallowen battled the foul spirit, but the specter was powerful, more powerful than Pallowen by far. But the druid knew that if she didn’t stop this evil, it would continue to spoil and corrupt the lands she loved. So Pallowen cried out to her god of nature and channeled every bit of earthen energy she could muster from the ground beneath them and into the specter, destroying herself in the process. Her desperate gambit worked, but only partially. The specter could not be destroyed but was instead sealed within a great tree. Its essence merged completely with its wooden prison and has been trapped since that day.</p><p>However, according to the legend, there is one night a year when the spirit, now known as Old Scarwood, is free to roam the world again. The transition between the seasons when all evil is at its most powerful. The day that is now known as Pallowen.</p><p></p><h2><strong>A Festival in Parts</strong></h2><p>A holiday filled with food, costumes, dancing, and stories, Pallowen begins at first light and ends at first light the following day. The traditional celebration is separated into several distinct parts, each representing Pallowen’s battle with Scarwood, though it’s not uncommon for urban areas to focus more on the masquerade and treat-giving aspects of the holiday rather than its more conventional aspects.</p><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Festival_in_parts.png\" /><h1><strong>The Grace</strong></h1><p>The Grace of Pallowen begins at first light and is a time to recognize the bounties of life and the harvest. The community fasts while gathering to decorate and prepare the feast and treats for the day of celebration. Carved pumpkins and straw bales are placed around the community center, and streamers and banners are hung from every home and storefront as decadent cakes, candies, and pastries are made in overt abundance to accommodate the coming festivities.</p><p>When the sun is at its highest, the community breaks its fast and begins the Great Meal—a time for family, friends, and welcomed visitors to come together and show their gratitude for the good in their lives. It’s customary that each person at the table takes a turn to speak their thanks aloud and acknowledge the fruitful gains they’ve made over the season, generally while receiving jovial ribbing and teasing from the others around the table.</p><p></p><h1><strong>The Warding</strong></h1><p>The Warding of Pallowen starts as the feasting ends and the sun begins to hang low in the sky. It’s the time of the holiday to focus on fear and how to face it. It’s a commonly held belief that Pallowen marks the transition between autumn and winter, and that this transitionary period on the Prime Material plane is a time when evil creatures and spirits, led by Old Scarwood himself, are at their most active and powerful. To ward off the creatures of the night and stop them from bringing famineand disease to the community, the people gather together and tell scary stories or legends of great evil. These tales are always told in the first person, as though the speakers themselves were the ones causing the terrors from their stories. The tales are told in this manner to trick Old Scarwood and any other wandering evils into believing that the village has already been claimed by nefarious beings bragging about their conquests, and thus any other villains traveling through the night can continue their search for vulnerable villages.</p><p>The second half of The Warding is full of fun and celebration. Everyone puts on colorful costumes and gathers the treats prepared earlier in the day, placing them in a large Pallowen Basket at the center of the village. After the treats are gathered together, all of the children (and lighthearted adults), who have dressed themselves as various monsters, demons, and villains, begin their parade around the perimeter of the village, winding around the streets and houses and marching past the Pallowen Basket to collect treats wrapped in parchment and scrawled with blessings and prayers for the season to come. After the parade has ended, everyone gathers together for dancing and games, celebrating for as long as they can as midnight approaches.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Costumes and Twisted Tales</strong></h2><p>Although the subjects and fears are localized, dressing up as and telling stories of notorious villains and creatures is the central theme that remains unchanged no matter where Pallowen is celebrated on the continent. Known as a Pallowen Mask, these adopted personas are believed to ensure the safety and prosperity of the community throughout the long dark season to come.</p><p>The @UUID[RollTable.HE8mVvaQLF6hQFx1]{Pallowen Masks} table below provides examples of villainous creatures that are often the subjects of costumes and tales.</p><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Pallowen_Masks_Table.png\" /><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Costumes.png\" height=\"313\" /><p></p><h1><strong>The Sealing</strong></h1><p>The Sealing of Pallowen occurs at midnight and is the time meant to honor and recognize the druid Pallowen’s sacrifice and to protect the village and people during the hard season to come. Midnight on Pallowen—being not only the transition of one day to another but of one season into the next—is believed to be the most dangerous time of the year. As the celebrations and festivities come to a close, villagers giddily rush back to their homes, laughing and scrambling to collect the pieces of parchment containing the good omens and tidings that their neighbors festooned their treats in on the way. To end the evening, and provide the final act of protection for the season to come, they burn the pieces of parchment on the doorsteps of their homes, sending the good wishes and blessings into the ether to join the spirit of Pallowen herself.</p><p>After midnight, the evening is said to belong to the unsavory and wicked forces of the world, both corporeal and spiritual. The custom of staying indoors after the sealing is most strictly adhered to in more rural parts of the world, but within more urban areas it can often mark when the evening’s revelry is just hitting its stride. However, even in remote villages, there are always young and adventurous folk who see it as a test of mettle or a rebellious shirking of superstition to sneak outdoors and experience what the night holds for them.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Festival Activities</strong></h2><p>The activities and games to be experienced during Pallowen can change depending on the country and region where it’s being celebrated, but there are a few typical festivities that accompany nearly every version of the festival.</p><p></p><h3>Harvest Hunt</h3><p>The harvest hunt happens in corn mazes, along labyrinthian woodland trails, or through obstacle courses constructed from tall stacks of straw bales. A favorite seasonal game of the exuberant and athletic, participants take on the role of either hunter or prey, racing through the maze to either corner their quarry or escape the hands of their pursuer.</p><p>The harvest hunt takes place over 6 rounds. Participants playing the role of hunter enter the harvest maze 1 round after the prey. Each round, each prey makes a DC 14 Intelligence check to find their way through the maze. If they are touched by a hunter, they are captured and cannot complete the maze. Hunters touch prey by making a melee attack roll against the prey’s unarmored AC. Prey survives the hunt once they have made 6 successful Intelligence checks without being touched by a hunter. The hunters win if no prey makes it completely through the maze.</p><p></p><h3>Masquerade</h3><p>The masquerade is a gorgeous and lively affair whether it takes place around a bonfire or in an elegant ballroom. Partygoers wear their most elaborate costumes—with more metropolitan guests even enchanting their garb with illusions—and dance and celebrate until moments before The Sealing begins, at which point the Lord of the Masquerade is chosen. Chosen by applause and general audience uproar, the new Lord is presented with a small hawthorn crown and hoisted on the shoulders of their new court before being carried back to their home.</p><p>Over the course of the masquerade, participants may make a DC 14 Charisma check to impress their fellow partygoers and gain their support. On a successful check, the participant gains the support of 5 partygoers, or 10 partygoers if the check succeeds by 5 or more. On a failed check, the participant gains no support or loses the support of 5 partygoers if the check fails by 5 or more. At the end of the masquerade, the participant who has gained the support of the most partygoers is crowned the Lord of the Masquerade. In the event of a tie, the winner is determined by a final contested Charisma check.</p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Masquerade.jpg\" width=\"222\" height=\"397\" /><p></p><h3>Pumpkin Toss</h3><p>A staple of rural celebrations, the pumpkin toss is a Pallowen test of strength where participants gather up carved gourds from their position around the community and attempt to throw them onto tall wooden stakes. Generally started long after the cider and ale have been flowing for hours, the toss is often more of a mirthful act of pumpkin destruction than a true test of skill.</p><p>Participants have 3 chances to land a pumpkin on one of 3 wooden stakes, each painted a different color and set 15 feet apart from one another. Landing a pumpkin on the red stake requires a successful DC 13 Strength check and nets the participant 2 points. Landing a pumpkin on the purple stake requires a successful DC 15 Strength check and nets the participant 4 points. Landing a pumpkin on the gold stake requires a successful DC 17 Strength check and nets the participant 7 points. After the participants have each completed 3 tosses, the one with the most points is declared the winner.</p><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/pumpkintoss.png\" /><h3>Stilt Fight</h3><p>A test of balance and coordination, the stilt fight pits two people on colorful, ribbon-wrapped stilts against one another over a pool filled with autumn leaves—or any other festive, cushiony material. Although attempts to dislodge one another from their perch can lead to spirited scuffles, this contest always ends in laughter and good-humored teasing among the contestants.</p><p>Participants roll initiative at the start of each round. The participant with the highest initiative can attempt to knock over their opponent by making a Strength (Athletics) check contested by their opponent’s Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If a participant is overcome by their opponent, they can save themselves by succeeding on a DC 14 Dexterity check. Each time a participant must save themselves, the DC for their Dexterity check increases by 2. Once a participant has knocked over their opponent, they are declared the winner.</p><p></p><h3>Warding Parade</h3><p>The warding parade is the heart and soul of Pallowen and the activity most looked forward to by children celebrating the holiday. Not only does it provide the perfect opportunity to show off the costumes that the villagers worked on for weeks, but according to tradition, it also wards away any lingering evil spirits that might try to hide in the community. The fact that it culminates in pulling treats from the Pallowen Basket makes it all the sweeter.</p><p>The below<strong> @UUID[RollTable.r50vB2XZ8L7mohdP]{Pallowen Basket Treats}</strong> table provides examples of what might be pulled from the basket at the end of the warding parade and what blessings might be attached to them.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Plot Hooks</strong></h2><p>The following are plot hooks that you can use to stir up some adventure on Pallowen.</p><p>• While traveling through a great swamp, the party realizes that midnight has passed on Pallowen, and the ominous feeling of being followed settles upon them. The rush to make it back to civilization now begins. On the outskirts of a small hamlet, the group is approached by a terrified young child who tells them that her mother is going to be sacrificed by the locals in an attempt to drive off Old Scarwood.</p><p>• During the Warding of Pallowen, the sound of snapping trees and piercing screams suddenly interrupts the festivities as several blighted and rotten treants amble into the town square.</p><p>• While walking down the street, an unseen force suddenly lifts a small food cart and throws it through a tavern window. Screams can be heard from the building as people spill into the street still dressed in their Pallowen costumes.</p><p>• Raina Pamerra, a local lord, has asked that a nearby dungeon be emptied out before midnight on Pallowen. She fears the evil within will devastate the countryside if left unchecked during this dangerous season.</p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/pallowen_card.png\" width=\"198\" height=\"278\" /><h1><strong>Guilds &amp; Orders: The Order of the Sentinals</strong></h1><p></p><blockquote><p>“All for the cause. All for the realm. All against the darkness.”</p><p>- Order of the Sentinels creed</p></blockquote><p></p><p>The Order of the Sentinels is an ancient and secret society dedicated to protecting mortals from the supernaturally evil threats that work to escape the confines of their planes and wreak havoc on the Prime Material Plane. These brave guardians risk their own lives and souls to ensure that nothing sinister crosses the Veil between the planes and that those creatures that make it through are tracked down and destroyed.</p><p></p><h1><strong>The Darken Veil</strong></h1><p>The Darken Veil is the wall between the Prime Material Plane and all planes and pocket planes dedicated to evil, insanity, and decay. It’s an extraordinary magical barrier said to have been built by the gods as an extra measure of protection upon the existing Planar Veil that creates the gulf between creatures of the Prime Material and the various planes around them. Crossing the Veil between planes is incredibly difficult, but piercing the Darken Veil is nearly impossible for the malevolent forces of the cosmology. However, this layer of protection can be breached by mortals attempting to reach through and contact the powerful dark beings on the other side. Those mortals who willingly peer through the Darken Veil do so at the risk of their sanity, lives, and spirits, but the exchange of power they may receive is too great for them to forego. Each time these individuals reach through the Darken Veil, whether just deep enough to scry or to directly call upon an extraplanar servant, they weaken the barrier and run the risk of something more powerful and dire than they could imagine slipping through.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Malefic Ripples</strong></h2><p>One of the primary tenets among the Order of the Sentinels is that every great tragedy, every terrible event created by the forces of evil, can be traced to a single facilitating moment. These moments of contact with the dark planes, or Malefic Ripples as they’re called by the Order, leave impressions on the Darken Veil that can be found by those trained to sense them. Sentinels spend their time investigating and tracking down the sources of these Malefic Ripples, seeking to eliminate any potentially world-altering schemes in their infancy. Budding necromancers touching the Necrotic Plane, gathering occultists tampering with dark artifacts, warlocks turning to the void, or summoners reaching out for fiendish minions, are all targets of the Order of the Sentinels’ justice.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Who Joins</strong></h2><p>The Order of the Sentinels welcomes people from all walks of life into their ranks, although they specifically seek out and recruit those who have been the victims of the supernatural tragedies and traumas they seek to prevent. After months of investigation and observation, a potential recruit will be approached by a standing member of the order and invited to join their fight against the forces of darkness in any way they can. The members of the Order of the Sentinels are bakers, farmers, warriors, midwives, scholars, and politicians, but above all else, they are enemies of what lies beyond the Darken Veil.</p><p><em><strong>You will thrive in the Order of the Sentinels if:</strong></em></p><p>• You do not trust extraplanar forces or those who use them.</p><p>• You would lay down your life to protect the realm.</p><p>• You are willing to provide whatever you can in service of the cause.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Divisions of the Order</strong></h2><p>The Order of the Sentinels is a society of individuals who share a common goal and general mindset. Members are unpaid, although any wealth or treasure taken by the group is divided evenly among the chapter who found it, with the most wealthy members abstaining in favor of those less fortunate. Sentinels always provide for each other in whatever ways they can, whether it be a place to stay for the night, provisions for a mission to come, or using their political connections to facilitate an objective. The Order of the Sentinels has four divisions spread throughout the realm who work together to keep watch on the world around them and maintain the secrecy of their order.</p><p></p><h3>Sentries</h3><p>Although this is the simplest position in the order, it’s also considered the most important. This division is filled with locals who have few skills and hold humble positions within their communities. Sentries make up the largest numbers in the Order and are the primary source of information distribution among the members. They go about their daily lives as normal, and when they spot any signs of Malefic Ripples in the area, they immediately report this to their assigned contact and continue to watch and wait.</p><p></p><h3>Endowers</h3><p>This division is responsible for supplying the members of the Order of the Sentinels with what they need for their quests and missions for the order. They are usually merchants, outfitters, and blacksmiths of varying types who are well supplied with money and resources.</p><p></p><h3>Seekers</h3><p>This is the most dangerous division in the order. These are the warriors and field investigators who seek out the sources of Malefic Ripples that have been reported. Seekers are willing to do whatever must be done to stop those powers that would cause devastation to society, and that can often lead them down dangerous and illegal paths. Seekers must be careful of not only the dark forces they’re hunting, but of the local law enforcement and officials of the areas they’re in.</p><p></p><h3>Torchbearers</h3><p>Torchbearers are the leaders of the order and generally hold positions of power in their communities. Elders, politicians, and sages are all typically found in this division, and it’s their responsibility to organize and coordinate their local chapter of the Order of the Sentinels. These are the people responsible for removing bureaucratic roadblocks hindering the Order’s members, assigning missions, and clearing up any legal troubles that the Seekers may cause.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Goals</strong></h2><p>The goals of the Order of the Sentinels have remained unchanged since its founding: seek out those who would pierce the Darken Veil and destroy them before they can destroy the innocent mortal lives around them, hunt down any evil creatures who have broken through, and never let the life of one individual outweigh the lives of all.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Guild Features</strong></h2><p>The following options are available to PCs who join the Order of the Sentinels.</p><p></p><h3>Order of the Sentinels (Advanced Background)</h3><p>After surviving a terrible supernatural calamity, you were sought out by a member of the @UUID[Item.EfCqy6gnMufT06JP]{Order of the Sentinels}and recruited. You have completed your esoteric training with the Order and can now spot evidence of intrusion on the Darken Veil.</p><p></p><h3>Feature: Trace the Ripples</h3><p>You can sense and @UUID[Item.4ONcEfmMAu7tZhlO]{locate Malefic Ripples} . You may use Intelligence (Arcana) checks to track and determine the approximate time and location that something attempted to cross or communicate with any evil-aligned plane for up to 1 day after the contact or crossing was attempted.</p><p></p><h3>The Sentinel’s Light</h3><p>Wondrous Item, Major, Uncommon</p><p>This gorgeously crafted lantern is owned by all members of the Order of the Sentinels and kept carefully hidden away unless needed. To the uninitiated, The @UUID[Item.xRZodD4IEItqbZJl]{The Sentinel's Light} looks like a well-made and ornate adventurer’s lantern, but this mystical item is the most important tool in the Order’s arsenal.</p><p>The Sentinel’s Light has 3 charges, and regains all expended charges daily at sunrise. You may spend 1 charge to cast one of the spells below:</p><p>• <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.BP3GCwa66IAw1yTG]{Daylight}</em></p><p>• <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Mzh95utKDPIrjiH8]{Detect Evil and Good}</em></p><p>• <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.xmDBqZhRVrtLP8h2]{Protection from Evil and Good}</em></p><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Sentinels_Light.png\" width=\"184\" height=\"298\" /><p></p><h1><strong>Cults and Syndicates: The Broken Bone</strong></h1><p></p><blockquote><p>“He is the Ivory Chain! He is the Grinning Master! He is the Deathless Destruction! And we shall make him great again.”</p><p>— Lysba Valkin, cleric of Ecrassus</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Dominance, of not only a body but of a spirit. Control, of not only a life but of the death that comes after. That is what Ecrassus requires from his followers. That is what drives the cult of the Broken Bone.</p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Cults_Syndicates.jpg\" /><p></p><h2><strong>Break the Bones</strong></h2><p>Members of the Broken Bone live their lives in service of Ecrassus, God of the Skeletal Throng. Before he fell from power, Ecrassus ruled over a vast roaming army of skeletal undead that endlessly traversed the Necrotic Plane. A brutal and merciless god-king, Ecrassus commanded his followers to kill, conquer, and subjugate in the worst ways possible, and the worshippers of this fallen deity work to continue his legacy of violence and tyranny from their scattered factions around the continent.</p><p>The Broken Bone exists in small, generally uncoordinated pockets on the fringes of society, among evil tribes of barbarians, or in countries where the opportunity to practice necromancy or slavery without repercussion is available. Although anyone may be mad enough to be taken in by this abysmal sect, the most common followers are those who enjoy the power and dominance championed by this cult or those who have been victims of the same for long enough to become broken and evil themselves. The most common leaders of these cells are clerics, inspired by the nearly forgotten doctrine of Ecrassus and gifted visions from beyond the veil, or necromancers who see themselves in command of their own ivory horde one day. Despite their lack of formal organization, no matter where this cult begins to grow or who is leading them, their methods are fairly predictable, falling in line with the tenets of their malevolent god. And Ecrassus’s demands are as simple as they are immutable; to break the weak and claim all they have to offer. Or, as his followers often chant,</p><p><em><strong>“Break the bones, reap the marrow.”</strong></em></p><p></p><h2><strong>Reap the Marrow</strong></h2><p>Once they have their foothold in an area, the cult will begin scouting out areas to raid. Small villages and farms are particularly vulnerable at this stage, as they typically have the smallest means of resistance and offer the quickest way for the Broken Bone to swell their ranks. After successfully overtaking a village, they will enslave any survivors and begin their darkest works. The cult of the Broken Bone believes that in order to create a true skeletal throng, one that will return their master to his former glory, they cannot simply kill and then raise the remains of their victims. Instead, they combine their necromantic rites with forced labor, ritualistically working their new slaves to death, breaking both their bodies and spirits before adding their skeletons to their burgeoning army.</p><p>The cult will repeat this grisly cycle for as long as they can, attacking larger and larger settlements and growing their numbers until they draw the ire of a contingent strong enough to put an end to their reign of terror, or Ecrassus provides their leader with some new malignant directive.</p><p></p><section id=\"secret-zFKbkwVANK9Elox6\" class=\"secret\"><p><em><strong>GM NOTE:</strong></em></p><p><strong>For altercations with members of the cult of the Broken Bone, utilizing the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.CHEUjiYrVM9X0vIT]{Acolyte}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.B7lBOr1AahNZs4a6]{Archmage}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.kz1t6xeXVwODpYb2]{Berserker}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.tYfQIxCJT0WaaKmc]{Cult Fanatic}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.mQnsXanewsPiV7QE]{Mage}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.PVD5wRdyO7iCJPs1]{Priest}, or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.nREPw9g94Bsb9sIl]{Tribal Warrior} stat blocks would all be appropriate, depending on the flavor and difficulty of the encounter you're running.

An elaborate headdress made of melded bones, this grim artifact is coveted by his followers and provides them with all of the necrotic abilities they need to spread his sinister dogma.</p><p><strong>Random Properties.</strong> The Crown of Bone has the following random properties:</p><p>• 2 @UUID[RollTable.XSMUSA2l1oUbiZ6n]{major beneficial properties}</p><p>• 1 @UUID[RollTable.zY9TGvasG2D15znC]{major detrimental properties}</p><p><strong>Master of Skeletons.</strong> While you are attuned to the Crown of Bone, you can use an action to attempt to dominate any skeletal creatures that are not currently under your control.

His search parties have all come up empty-handed. With rumors of raiders growing in the area, and his desperation peaking, the wealthy merchant is willing to offer a fortune to any brave souls who can find her.</p><p>• News has come that Delk’s Peak has been completely overrun by savage barbarians. The few survivors who have managed to escape are telling tales of people being led away in chains and skeletal warriors running rampant.</p><p>• The people at the tavern are all abuzz about the madman who wandered into town overnight. He’s currently sitting in the local jail, ranting about the coming of “the ivory chain” and drawing incoherent scribbles in the dirt.</p><p>• A young acolyte of a local church has been having visions of an approaching skeletal army. No one has given their dreams much thought, but now that rumors of undead lurking in nearby ruins have reached the ears of the Bishop, she’s looking for a group to investigate.</p><p>• After a successful skirmish with a group of orcs, searching their bodies reveals a strange symbol made of human bone and a crudely drawn map to an apparent gathering place.</p><p></p><h1><strong>Infested: Parasites For Your Game</strong></h1><p></p><blockquote><p>“There are thousands of ways to die, millions if you’re really creative. I would take any of them over what did that.”</p><p>- Kinsey Stafford, Apprentice Field Medic</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Adventurers seem to have a habit of going to great lengths to put themselves where they don’t belong. Traversing far-off mountains, exploring dense jungles, or crossing shifting deserts means risking many dangers—both seen and unseen. And before any inexperienced party heads off into the great unknown, they’re often given words of warning and wisdom from their more experienced peers. Told in no uncertain terms that there are ravenous beasts, evil hordes, and supernatural monsters waiting to pounce in the wild places where adventurers are driven to explore, a fresh-faced group might feel emboldened by the knowledge that’s passed their way. But although knowing how to spot and avoid a massive danger will surely prolong the life of a traveling hero, sometimes the gravest threats these areas contain come in the smallest packages.</p><p></p><section id=\"secret-hGnQumUdo4m6MONS\" class=\"secret\"><p><em><strong>GM NOTE, Content Warning:</strong></em></p><p>This new game option introduces an element that some players may find too disturbing to enjoy. Beyond the painful and often grotesque physical symptoms that accompany parasites, these tiny scourges can also bring about feelings of invasion and violation that characters must overcome.</p><p>Whereas some players may find this to be an enjoyable (if somewhat disgusting) obstacle for their character to face, others might find that exploring these particular themes in any way ruins the fun of their game and potential story arc for their character. As with all new rules and game options, it is highly recommended that potentially including parasites in your game is discussed during your pre-campaign conversations or during your group’s session zero.</p></section><p></p><h2><strong>Parasite Mechanics</strong></h2><p>Beyond adding a layer of revulsion and paranoia, parasites bring a new condition into the game—infested. Unless otherwise stated in a parasite’s description block, any spell or effect that detects disease or poison or ends disease or the poisoned condition will detect parasites or end the infested condition as well.</p><p>The effects of being infested are as follows:</p><p></p><h3>Infested</h3><p>• An infested creature has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws and Wisdom (Perception) checks.</p><p></p><h3>Effects</h3><p>In addition to the infested condition, most parasites cause unique effects that are detailed in their description block. The Effect section of a parasite’s block describes the duration, damage, and any other ramifications that an infestation from that parasite may cause.</p><p></p><h3>Becoming Infested</h3><p>Each parasite’s description block indicates how a creature becomes infested with that particular parasite by specifying whether it is external or internal. External parasites are typically contracted by passing through and coming into physical contact with an affected area or object. Internal parasites are generally contracted by a creature introducing the parasite into its system by drinking or eating contaminated materials or receiving an injury from some infested creatures.</p><p></p><h3>Detecting Parasites</h3><p>Parasites, like diseases and poisons, cannot be detected by nonmagical means, although a discerning character could make an appropriate skill check (Arcana, Nature, Medicine, or Survival) to realize the symptoms in another creature and tie them to the parasite in question. The DC for such checks should be determined by the GM as is appropriate to the circumstance.</p><p></p><h3>Harvesting</h3><p>Particularly adventurous characters may attempt to harvest parasites for later use. Should a character detect or discover a source of parasites, via magical or nonmagical means, they can follow the standard rules for harvesting poison to do so. Should they succeed in their necessary skill checks as determined by the GM, they can harvest one use of the parasite. If they fail, they are infested and subjected to the parasite’s effects as normal.</p><p></p><h3>Treatment</h3><p>Outside of spells or features that remove the infested condition from a creature, the most common way to remove parasites is through the use of an antiparasitic. Any character who has proficiency with an Herbalism Kit may create a single dose of a basic antiparasitic over the course of two hours if they have the necessary materials available.</p><p>It should be noted that anything that ends the infested condition on a creature will also end the effects of the parasite affecting them.</p><p></p><h3>Antiparasitic</h3><p>Adventuring Gear</p><p>30 gp</p><p>This @UUID[Item.7mapJQJk84QyOKfL]{potent tincture} provides a creature with advantage on saving throws against infestation for 1 hour or ends the infested condition in a currently affected creature.</p><p></p><p>Some parasites are more exotic, virulent, or magical than others and require one or more special materials in order to make an effective antiparasitic to prevent or treat their infestation. If special materials are necessary, they will be listed in the parasite’s description block.</p><p></p><h2><strong>New Parasites</strong></h2><p>The following are new parasites that you can introduce into your games. GMs should feel free to use the below as templates for creating their own parasites for later use, or to alter the saving throw DCs, durations, or descriptions of those provided to better fit their campaigns.</p><p></p><h3>Dream Eaters (Internal)</h3><p>Dream eaters are leech-like creatures that inhabit the sands of deserts and beaches. They spend most of their lives in hibernation among the dunes, only waking when they sense the presence of a warm-blooded creature in their vicinity. Those unfortunate enough to make camp among the dream eaters stir these parasites from their slumber, causing the worms to slowly climb from the sands and make their way up and into their victim’s ear canal. By the next morning, the throbbing pain in the affected creature’s ears, combined with the constant scritching of the dream eater’s movements, makes sleep and concentration nearly impossible.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Effect:</strong></p><p><strong>Dream eaters cause incessant pain and irritation in the ears of those they afflict. A creature subjected to this parasite must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.</strong></p><p><strong>On a successful save, the creature is infested for 2d12 hours.</strong></p><p><strong>On a failed save, the infestation lasts 2d4 days.</strong></p><p><strong>While infested, the creature has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration and cannot complete a long rest.</strong></p></blockquote><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Parasite1.png\" width=\"231\" height=\"328\" /><h3>Gorgon’s Kiss (Internal)</h3><p>Gorgon’s kiss are minute parasites that dwell on flowers and other vibrant flora, nesting among the pollen that the plants produce. As the wind carries the infested particles through the air, they’re inhaled by unlucky creatures passing through the clouds of spores, at which point the parasites begin their assault on their hosts’ bodies. As gorgon’s kiss moves through the infested creature, feasting on the blood flowing through their bodies, they excrete a substance that crystallizes and hardens, causing increasing amounts of pain and lethargy in their host. Allowed to go unchecked, the victims of gorgon’s kiss are left completely petrified by the crystals throughout their body.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Effect:</strong></p><p><strong>Gorgon’s kiss causes lethargy, pain, and eventual petrification in those they infest. A creature that contracts this parasite must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw.</strong></p><p><strong>On a failed save, it is infested and immediately gains 1 level of exhaustion. Exhaustion gained by gorgon’s kiss cannot be removed while the afflicted creature is infested.</strong></p><p><strong>Every 4 hours, the infested creature must repeat its saving throw.</strong></p><p><strong>On a failure, it takes 2d6 slashing damage. While infested, if the afflicted creature fails 3 saving throws, they become restrained. After failing 6 total saving throws, the infested creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.</strong></p></blockquote><p></p><h3>Hermit Hounds (Internal)</h3><p>Hermit hounds are thin, translucent worms that are found infesting the waters and wildlife of forested areas. Incredibly difficult to see, they’re most commonly encountered by novice adventurers and careless woodsmen who improperly prepare game or drink water tainted with the parasite. After infestation, hermit hounds cause a noticeable change in the personality of their host, making them prone to irritation and paranoia and driving them to become more and more isolated. Once driven into seclusion in the wilderness, the host most typically falls victim to another wild animal or creature that the hermit hounds then pass on to.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Effect:</strong></p><p><strong>Hermit hounds cloud the mind and dull their host’s personality. A creature that drinks water or eats food contaminated with this parasite must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw.</strong></p><p><strong>On a failed save, the creature is infested for 1d10 days and has disadvantage on all Charisma saving throws and ability checks, avoiding the effects on a success.</strong></p></blockquote><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Parasite2.png\" width=\"232\" height=\"171\" /><p></p><h3>Storm Mites (External)</h3><p>Storm mites are aquatic arthropods roughly the size and shape of a copper piece. In most circumstances, these creatures remain in the shallow tidal pools where they’re born without ever coming into contact with people. However, during periods of monsoons and flooding, minuscule storm mite larvae are swept inland where they burrow under the skin of anyone they touch, creating excruciating clusters of boils and making it almost impossible to wear anything heavier than a loose tunic. After incubating within their host, the mature mites burst out of their host’s flesh, causing even more pain and trauma to their victim’s body.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Effect:</strong></p><p><strong>Storm mites burrow into the skin, causing painful and grotesque boils where they gather. A creature that comes into contact with this parasite must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.</strong></p><p><strong>On a failed save, the creature is infested for 1d6 days while the mites incubate. During this period, the pustules caused by the incubating mites make wearing light, medium, or heavy armor impossible. At the end of their incubation period, the mites burst from their host's skin, causing 3d4 piercing damage.</strong></p></blockquote><p></p><h3>Wraith Kin (External)</h3><p>Wraith kin are tiny, transparent jellies that dwell in caves and dank dungeons throughout the realms. They wait on floors, walls, and ceilings in a dormant state until a living creature passes near them, rousing them from their slumber, at which point they attach themselves to their host's flesh. The impact of the wraith kin can be noticed immediately on their host, who finds themself suddenly depleted of their vitality and life force. Given their near-invisible bodies and the draining effects they have on those they infest, they are rumored to be a type of undead, though this is yet to be proven.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Effect:</strong></p><p><strong>Wraith kin attach to their host’s flesh, leeching their energy and spirit. A creature whose flesh comes into contact with wraith kin must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.</strong></p><p><strong>On a failed save, the creature becomes infested for 2d6 days, or avoiding the effect on a success.</strong></p><p><strong>While infested, the creature’s hit point maximum is reduced by 4d4.</strong></p></blockquote><p></p><h2><strong>Infesting Spells</strong></h2><p>The following are new infesting spells characters can use to pass along the unwelcome pains of parasites or GMs can use to fill in the spellbooks of their insidious NPCs.</p><p></p><blockquote><p>@UUID[Item.EWGZKXbWNAZejaje]{Infesting Grasp}</p><p>1st-level conjuration</p><p>Casting Time: 1 action</p><p>Range: Touch</p><p>Components: V, S</p><p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>You reach out and clutch a target creature, summoning the virulent might of nature’s tiniest terrors. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 piercing damage and is infested. At the start of each of their turns for the duration, the infested creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take an additional 1d8 piercing damage. On a success, the effect ends on that creature, and they are no longer infested.</p><p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.</p><p>Classes: druid, ranger</p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p>@UUID[Item.Uf9u64Dq73nmEhZy]{Cloak of Grotesque Multitudes}</p><p>2nd-level conjuration</p><p>Casting Time: 1 action</p><p>Range: Self</p><p>Components: V, S</p><p>Duration: 1 Hour</p><p>You bite back your revulsion and cover your body with a swarm of parasites that disgusts your opponents and confuses their strikes. Each time a creature targets you with a melee attack during the spell's duration, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target creature’s attack misses you, and they instead take 1d6 piercing damage and become infested. On a success, the creature’s attack continues as normal.</p><p>This spell ends when your saving throw is failed three times or when you dismiss it as an action. While this spell is active, you have disadvantage on all Charisma-based skill checks but Intimidation.</p><p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the number of saving throw failures that can be experienced before the spell ends increases by 1 for each slot level above 2nd.</p><p>Classes: druid, ranger, warlock</p></blockquote><p></p><h2><strong>Creature Features</strong></h2><p>The following are a few example features GMs can apply to existing creatures to allow them to access and utilize the rules for parasites presented in this supplement.</p><p></p><p><em><strong>Master of Plagues.</strong></em> When the [name of creature] successfully damages a creature with a spell, the damaged creature must make an additional Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature has disadvantage on saving throws made to resist being diseased, infested, or poisoned. This effect lasts until the affected creature completes a long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Revolting Body.</strong></em> When a creature within 30 feet of the [name of creature] targets it with an attack, the attacking creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or that creature cannot select the [name of creature] as the target of their attack.</p><p><em><strong>Teeming.</strong></em> A creature that touches the [name of creature] or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 piercing damage and become infested. A creature that has already been infested by this feature does not take additional damage from subsequent activations of this feature.</p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Creature_Feature_Image.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /><p></p><h1><strong>Heprion's Guide: Legendary Cursed Items</strong></h1><p></p><blockquote><p>“I’ve spent my life cataloging treasures with extraordinary properties.

Since they’re rarely summoned outright, they generally accomplish this through assisting greater demons and devils in their schemes, finding gates or portals, and taking advantage of the mistakes of naive or inexperienced cultists.</p><p></p><p>@UUID[Actor.MmH2oVwHg9fP4kNp]{Black-eyed Child}</p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/byc_statblock.png\" />","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Monsters Mythica: Dread Coachman","type":"text","_id":"9Dy5Nzc0o2NFnxPa","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>@UUID[Actor.V1uPutZd3SDbs09D]{Dread Coachman}</p><p></p><blockquote><p>“Have I been cursed? Once again I was upon the ramparts on Pallowen, and once again, the gods granted me a terrible vision. I was doing my patrols when the air grew so chill I thought I would freeze in my armor. Suddenly I heard a terrible racket from above and looked up to see a carriage, pulled by spectral horses and driven by a coachman so horrible I thought my heart would seize up. I watched as he passed over one of my fellow guards and pulled him into his wretched cart before vanishing into the night sky. I will never forget it. And I will certainly be switching shifts next year.”</p><p>- From the report of Falen Cooper, wall guard</p></blockquote><p></p><p>The crack of a whip. The terrible clattering of hooves cutting through the still night air. The ghastly inevitability of what this creature of retribution carries with it in its loathsome carriage. These are the details of stories whispered by cutthroats in back alleys and by bandits around their campfires. Tales of punishment for crimes left unanswered and of victims left unavenged. Beware, they say, with their eyes turned toward the starless sky and what it holds beyond its borders. Beware the dread coachman.</p><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/dread_coachman2.png\" /><p></p><h2><strong>Soul Collector</strong></h2><p>A dread coachman, or collector of souls as it’s called in some regions around the continent, is not only a harbinger of death but of eternal punishment. Sent from beyond the realms of mortal men to bring retribution from vengeful gods or otherworldly beings, once a dread coachman has been tasked with a bounty, they cannot return to their masters empty-handed. There is no stretch of the Prime Material that their victims could go where the dread coachman would not find them. Once they have discovered their target, they make their intentions known by calling out their name and their crimes in a voice that resonates within the chests of all who can hear it. After that, it’s only a matter of time before they're within the dark oblivion of the dread coachman’s carriage, never to be seen again.</p><p>Not even death can dissuade the dread coachman, as it’s sometimes sent to gather lost souls wandering through the planes to bring them in for their final judgments, especially those that led dark lives and have failed to move on to their gods.</p><p>Through the popularity of the folklore surrounding it, this particular wraith has gained a reputation for bringing evil men to meet their ultimate justice, but the truth is a far grimmer matter. The dread coachman is an amoral creature, only capable of carrying out the acts of revenge directed to it by its master, whether those commands are truly just or not. Villain or hero, guilty or innocent, once their taskmaster has delivered their judgment, the dread coachman can only obey.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Broken Bonds</strong></h2><p>The dread coachman’s imprisonment to the whims of their master begins at their creation, which occurs when the follower or servant of a god or other immortal betrays their sacred covenant. Regardless of whether the betrayal was purposeful or inadvertent, the punishment is the same; an infinity of horrid servitude.</p><p>There are rare circumstances when the bonds between a dread coachman and their commander are severed, usually through planar events or powerful artifactual magic. When this happens, the creature begins to rot and is driven entirely into darkness, harvesting as many souls as it can and growing in power and maliciousness until it is finally driven from the plane. Or, in the worst instances, until it is bound to a more nefarious source on the Prime Material.</p><p></p><section id=\"secret-ac3hMr3R0dhGAylm\" class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM NOTES: WHIP OF SORROWS</strong></p><p>When a dread coachman is defeated, they’re driven back to their plane of origin, leaving behind their primary weapon, the whip of all sorrows.</p><p>@UUID[Item.u5r4IJerJxl91gsz]{Whip of All Sorrows}</p><p><strong>Whip of All Sorrows</strong></p><p>Weapon (Whip), Rare (Requires Attunement)</p><p>This ghoulish whip is made from the polished bones of a multitude of different humanoids and ends in a cruel barb.</p><p>While attuned to this whip, you have resistance to necrotic damage, and this weapon does an additional 2d8 necrotic damage.</p></section><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/dread_coachman.png\" /><p></p><h2><strong>Plot Hooks</strong></h2><p>The following are plot hooks you can use to introduce or interact with this new creature:</p><p>• “Call the guards! The bloody coachman is here for me, and I’ve done nothing wrong!” As the dread coachman passes through the house the woman ran out of, cold air hits you, and the smell of putrid death comes along with it.</p><p>• You’re stopped by the local sheriff as you pass her building. She tells you that she’s noticed how you hold yourself and how well-armed you are and says she’s looking for assistance. “A flying carriage has been seen over the past few weeks, and each time it’s reported, people come up missing. Could you help us find out what’s happening?”.</p><p>• As you’re walking down the road, you suddenly hear your name being called out. It echoes in the air and reverberates through your chest. “Your name has been given, and I have come to collect your soul!”</p><p>• After traveling through the mountains for some time, you come upon a strange carriage with a missing wheel. From behind it, a voice calls out, “Do not fear me, for I have not come for you. The one I seek has done much evil against both humanity and the gods.” A hideous coachman steps from behind the carriage and continues speaking. “But I could use your assistance.”</p><p>• As you stop in the city, you see a post that reads, “Only the brave should apply. Saviors needed to face and defeat a ghastly magical creature. It and its carriage have somehow been trapped inside old farmer MiCallan’s barn outside of town. All previous attempts to destroy it have failed. Upon completion of this mission, the heroes would receive our eternal gratitude and much gratuity. Report to Governor Ernistall at the courthouse with interest.”</p><p></p><p>@UUID[Actor.V1uPutZd3SDbs09D]{Dread Coachman}</p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/dread_coachman_statblock.png\" /><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Monsters Mythica: Terrors of the Deep Woods - Bunny Man","type":"text","_id":"JL15BnLKLqipsetq","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>There are woods so deep and so dark they mirror the ocean in their mystery and grandeur.

They are revenants seeking themselves. Tasked to roam the unhallowed woods, forever seeking their own kin.”</p><p>~ Egress Varn, High Priest of the Eternal Ember Temple</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Tales of what punishments befall mortals who break the sanctity of enchanted lands are plentiful. Hunters who mark a sacred beast as their prey. Woodsmen who fell the wrong tree in a grove. Guardians of the earthen realms who fail their lords in their solemn duties. All must pay a price in order to prevent future transgressions from their kind. But none have paid so heavily as the ones they call the bunny men.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Cursed Guardians</strong></h2><p>Bunny men are hulking, malevolent creatures, cursed by fey or similar otherworldly beings for perceived trespasses against the flora and fauna within their domains. A cruel amalgam of hare and humanoid, bunny men are stripped of any mercy, benevolence, or reason that they once possessed and doomed to act as guardians in the lands that they offended, hunting down and eliminating anyone foolish or careless enough to wander into the territories they’ve been loosed upon.</p><p>Typically cursed and created by evil fey, bunny men are highly valued by deep woods hags and their adjacent ilk for both their bloodthirsty natures and ceaseless capabilities. Along with any thread of goodness that once remained in the wretched creatures, bunny men are deprived of their ability to sleep or rest, instead tasked with endlessly searching and surveying the lands of their masters for any potential threats or victims they might find there. A fell combination of finely-honed skill and bequeathed magics, bunny men are master hunters. Perfectly suited to force their way through any obstacle or hindrance set before them, once a bunny man has sighted their prey, they cannot stop their pursuit until either they or their target has been returned to the dark soil.</p><p>The bunny men’s tool of choice for their grim business is the same no matter what their long-forgotten origins may have been — a woodsmen’s axe, larger and sharper than any that they would have wielded in their past life and dripping with steady rivulets of blood that seep from the head of the weapon itself. It’s said that with every drop of blood that falls from their axe, another piece of who they once were is lost to the ether. Whether or not that is true, in the rare moments that a bunny man gains some small semblance of lucidity, it comes as more curse than blessing.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Bloodsoaked Relief</strong></h2><p>When a bunny man has achieved their singular goal, their axe slick with blood brought from outside of the woods they are forsaken to protect, they’re allowed a brief moment of bittersweet rest. Standing among the remains of the lives they snuffed out, their muscles go slack, their mind slows, and they lose themselves to whatever place these tortured and tortuous creatures go in these scarce moments. In this trance-like state, the bunny man remembers. Remembers who they once were, what events led them to their cursed shape and the many wicked things they have been charged to do since then. And, in the face of the infinite sadness of that tiny moment, they remember how to scream. It’s during this time that truly vicious and vengeful creators might visit their inconsolable warden, making promises of an eventual release from their curse and reinstatement of the life they lost before committing their terrible crimes against the earthen realm. These are, of course, lies and further cruelties that the bunny man will forget by sunrise. On the rare occasion that a bunny man has outlived their usefulness to their master, they are turned wholly into a hare. Fulfilling the fey’s darkest sense of humor and finally making the full transformation from predator to prey.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Harvestable Materials:</strong></h2><p></p><h3><strong>Bunny Man’s Axe</strong></h3><p>@UUID[Item.qYTqJsseiV0YyH35]{Bunny Man's Axe}</p><p><em><strong>Weapon (Greataxe), Rare (Requires Attunement)</strong></em></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p><p>When you roll a maximum result on the damage die for an attack you make with this axe, the target creature must make a Constitution saving throw whose DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.

From the snakes slithering their way through the underbrush, to the owls roosted high in the hollows of maple trees, to the squirrels that get caught by either somewhere in between. The particulars that make up the wild dreamscapes that these beasts roam are unknown to most, but it’s their nightmares that mortals must be wary of. When the creatures of the woods touch that dread plane in unison, in the face of a threat to them all, the nightmares they produce can be made flesh and bone. Nightmares that almost reflect their own kind. Nightmares like the not deer.</p><p></p><section id=\"secret-gOx6Qvetxt17cxkj\" class=\"secret\"><p><em><strong>GM NOTES: OPHCIPHAEL, THE PLANE OF NIGHTMARES</strong></em></p><p>In the cosmology of Quaseloth, the Underground Oracle campaign setting, Ophciphael is a shifting plane of nightmares created when a vengeful celestial being destroyed itself to punish the sins of mortals.</p></section><p></p><h2><strong>Unnatural Response</strong></h2><p>Not deer are denizens of Ophciphael, the Plane of Nightmares. Created by the coalesced fear and mental anguish of groups of creatures crying out together in their dreams, these monstrous beings are an unnatural response to equally unnatural threats faced by the forest. Arcane disasters blighting the land, clearcutting and razing to make way for the progress of humanity, stygian energies oozing from a tear in the planes that corrupts the natural order. Any of these events could give rise to a not deer.</p><p>Although given form on Ophciphael, not deer cannot physically manifest on the Prime Material without first being born. Entering the womb of a pregnant doe through the dreams of her unborn, the not deer waits, slowly draining the life from one of the unfortunate fawns within and eventually taking its place alongside its sibling. The resulting labor is a bloody and loathsome affair that encapsulates the trauma and turmoil that gave the creature its very essence. After its true birth, the not deer rises from the gore-slicked ground on too-steady legs with too many joints and takes its place among its new family.</p><p>Despite their wholly unnatural and unsettling presence, the creatures the not deer surrounds themselves with do not appear to notice or care about their newest herd member’s physical or behavioral irregularities. Like all nightmares, the not deer is an inherently insidious creature, able to twist and manipulate the perceptions of those around it so only the most enchanted beast or earthen creature would be able to discern its true nature. The not deer assumes an adult form overnight and, after driving any competing bucks or predators in the area to destroy themselves in fits of froth-spitting rage and frenzy, takes its place at the center of the herd. And it begins to feed.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Fear Eater</strong></h2><p>Not deer consume the psychic energy of living creatures around them, siphoning their discomfort, fear, and pain to sustain themselves. Although the beasts of the forest offer little in the way of intelligence, in large enough numbers, the not deer can still gorge itself without fully depleting its food source. Perfectly willing to disrupt the natural order, the not deer will lead its herd into disease, famine, and catastrophe so that it might enjoy a heartier meal while remaining careful not to let the bulk of its resources succumb to their circumstances. Not deer will even go so far as to assist in whatever disaster created it if it’s able, or at the very least, keep anyone from attempting to remedy the situation.</p><p>When faced with an intelligent threat, the not deer will employ the same mind-clouding methods and eldritch subterfuge it does on the beasts around it, but instead of savoring this new meal it will seek to fully consume and destroy the mind of its foe as soon as is possible. Unwilling to let its presence be known for risk of being ejected from the plane, the not deer will use every tool in its nightmarish arsenal to protect itself and destroy its enemies, including calling on its false family to defy their instincts and viciously attack its adversaries.</p><p></p><h2 data-anchor=\"harvestable-materials:\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:1rem 0px 0.5rem;padding:0px;font-weight:normal;font-size:1.5em;border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header);color:rgb(25, 24, 19);font-family:Signika, sans-serif;font-style:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">Harvestable Materials:</strong></span></h2><p></p><h3><strong>Not Deer Antler</strong></h3><p>@UUID[Item.yJv3c49Te8sya8ef]{Not Deer Antler}</p><p>When it is destroyed, the not deer is shunted back to the Plane of Nightmares, leaving behind a rancid-smelling puddle of dark purple ooze and a single piece of antler.</p><p><em><strong>Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)</strong></em></p><p>This antler can be used as a spellcasting focus.

But where did I find myself on the evening? Guarding a caravan of wine and silks and praying to the gods I made it to morning. Those white devils trailed us for miles. Weaving in and out of the trees and vanishing from sight in a blink. Until the day I die, I’ll remember those howls. But not nearly as clearly as Jonathan’s screams as they drug him into the night.”</p><p>~ From the report of Falen Cooper, transport guard</p></blockquote><p></p><p>While traveling through the wilds or on vacant trails along towering woods, a noisy night can be a true blessing. The sounds of animals filling the air may be disconcerting to people better acquainted with life inside city walls than without, but for well-worn travelers, the sounds of nature are the sounds of normalcy. It’s the still nights that are truly terrifying. When the wind seems nervous to come as more than a whisper and the moonless sky hangs heavy and stifling overhead. It’s on those nights the true monsters are about, waiting to pierce that unnatural silence with their ragged, shrieking howls.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Monstrous Bloodline</strong></h2><p>White things resemble many-limbed wolves the size of bears. They roam far and wide through their wooded territories, perpetually trying to sate their nearly endless lust for rending and feasting on flesh and bone. Consummate killers, white things will gladly tear their way through herds of prey animals or even apex predators foolish enough to see the white things as nothing more than rival beasts. But although their environments are flush with creatures ripe for the picking, the white things are always drawn back to the source of their first taste of blood.</p><p>Before they were the terrible beings they are today, the first white things were a different sort of monster altogether. A small family of nobles known for their heavy-handed handling of the people under their banner and the battle￾hungry way they acquired new territory around their lands, they were as fierce as they were cold and cared only for those that shared their bloodline. They had been skirmishing for months with a small group of resistance fighters in the hills of their newest territory when the matriarch of the noble family had finally had enough. Leading the charge herself with her children beside her, they razed the hillside without any regard for the people there, eventually forcing the leaders of the resistance to turn themselves over in an attempt to stop the wanton violence.</p><p>As the leaders of the resistance stood bound on the gallows, the gloating matriarch allowed them to say their final words before sending them on to oblivion. The eldest of the resistance, a man whose back bent double under the weight of the years he carried, stepped forward and used his dying words to cry out a curse, begging his god to reveal these devil’s dogs as the monsters they truly were. And as the old man’s rope went taut, it punctuated his prayer with a sound like a thunderclap that was said to be heard for miles before settling into an unnatural silence. The air then filled with the shrieking howls of the matriarch and her noble family and the desperate cries of their men.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Silent Night</strong></h2><p>After tearing their soldiers to unrecognizable shreds, the white things abandoned their realm for woodlands that suited their new forms and hungers, spreading through the darkest woodlands over the centuries that followed and terrorizing travelers foolish enough to brave the night. When the moon is new, white things slip silently through the forest and along roadsides, fading in and out of the trees like a fog and trailing unsuspecting parties until the perfect time to strike. What they may lack in the intelligence their ancestors once possessed, the white things make up for with bestial instinct, flesh-rending claws, and the ability to seemingly fade into and out of thin air when they please.</p><p>It’s said that when the white things are on the prowl, the night goes dead silent, as though the entire world and all of the living things in it were holding their breath. Seasoned caravaners and travelers know to be wary when the night gets too quiet and to prepare for the white things to come. But the truly wise know that when their shrieking howls cut through the night air, it’s already too late.</p><p></p><h2 data-anchor=\"harvestable-materials:\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:1rem 0px 0.5rem;padding:0px;font-weight:normal;font-size:1.5em;border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header);color:rgb(25, 24, 19);font-family:Signika, sans-serif;font-style:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">Harvestable Materials:</strong></span></h2><p></p><h3><strong>Pelt of the White Thing</strong></h3><p>@UUID[Item.ZBBOQUMNPq6u5ZJC]{Pelt of the White Thing}</p><p>When a white thing is killed, it falls to the ground the same way as any natural animal, and although its pelt can be harvested from its carcass, there is nothing natural about it.</p><p><em><strong>Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)</strong></em></p><p>Your Dexterity and Strength each increase by 2 (the pelt may increase these scores above 20), and you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't silvered.</p><p>While wearing this pelt, you can transform your hands into savage claws to make an unarmed strike as a bonus action.

This effect remains until the curse is removed and you break attunement to the pelt.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Plot Hooks</strong></h2><p>The following are plot hooks you can use to introduce these woodland horrors to your group of adventurers.</p><p>• A local man named Terrel Lawrence went on a hunting trip into the woods several weeks ago but has yet to return. His family is looking for a brave group of folks to mount a search party and bring him home.</p><p>• A commotion in the center of town has set off the alarm bells and sent the guards running toward the source of turmoil. As a woman runs by, she screams that there’s a rabbit monster hacking people apart!Animals in the area have been behaving strangely, attacking hunters and each other without regard to their natural instincts. The village elder needs someone to find out what’s causing this behavior before someone is seriously hurt.</p><p>• Progress has stopped on the construction of the king’s newest road, with the workers in the camp at the forest’s edge reporting terrible weakness and the inability to sleep due to terrifying nightmares.</p><p>• Local farmers report that some sort of fiend or ghost is tearing their livestock to shreds. Witnesses say that the monsters are white as snow and disappear as you look at them. A young member of the Colossi, a renowned monster hunters guild, is looking for assistance in tracking down a group of white things that are terrifying caravaners on the high road.</p><p></p><p>@UUID[Actor.cIjAdP7it4ik4gXR]{White Things}</p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/white_thing_statblock.png\" />","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1667083255669,"modifiedTime":1667790510190,"lastModifiedBy":"YQ88Zx2ssDk4TvZ2"},"_id":"3LU2sPcRUAi8hV6j","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"YQ88Zx2ssDk4TvZ2":3}}

They could remember men and women, faces young and old running the gamut of expressions in their mind. They could even remember some of their names. Too many names. Was one of them theirs? How very curious, they thought.</p><p>Why had they never noticed these colors? So bright and so many in their shades and tones. Had there always been so many? And the scents, and the sounds, and the feeling of their feet on the ground. The feeling of their skin on their muscle on their bone. These they remembered, didn’t they? They tried to catch one of the chaotic memories skittering through their mind, something recalling all of these myriad sensations. But they came away from the rolling swarm of thoughts with only essences. Like a close friend describing a feeling rather than the feeling itself.</p><p>Friends. Those they remembered. Little sparks of light in a darkness so thick and clinging and intense that breaking free of it was like being born.</p><p>They would find their friends.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>The Plane of Nightmares is a labyrinthian miasma composed of the multitudes of fears and terrors of the creatures of the planes. From the panic of prey animals fleeing snapping jaws to the creeping dread of monarchs awaiting their assassin’s blades, when eyes close and minds float freely into the waiting black, the Plane of Nightmares is where they come ashore. It’s from this twisted realm of infinite and terrible possibility that the terrorborn emerge.</p><p>Strange beings made of a thousand coalesced fears and snatches of stolen memories, the terrorborn wander the Prime Material with an almost childlike curiosity, bearing witness to sights and sounds for the first time unfiltered by the fear of the dreaming. Some terrorborn understand their origins entirely and find themselves strangely delighted by their new form of existence. Others suffer in confusion, lost in the ill-fitting memories of an identity that was never meant to be theirs. In either case, the terrorborn often find themselves drawn to a life of adventure. Some seeking to experience every fresh new thing that corporeal life has to offer, while others are desperately chasing ghosts that cannot provide them with the answers they desire.</p><p></p><h1>Nightmare Ancestry</h1><p>Although the terrorborn are spawned from many fears, each one has a specific nightmare ancestry that makes up the core of their being. This ancestry not only impacts how they look when they reveal their nightmare form but may also impact how they act in the world. A terrorborn whose nightmare ancestry is related to spiders might constantly find themselves toying with the crawling insects and silently relishing the looks of disgust from those around them, while a terrorborn whose nightmare ancestry is taken from the fear of heights might spend their nights running along precarious rooftops.</p><p>When you select this lineage, choose one of the ancestries below to provide inspiration for your character and to determine which of the traits you gain in your lineage’s traits description.</p><p></p><section id=\"secret-6yEmMnpqoSmXen3W\" class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM NOTES: GUISE AND NIGHTMARE TRAITS</strong></p><p>Each of the nightmare ancestry options includes guise traits and nightmare traits. Guise traits indicate traits that your chosen humanoid form might have while on the Prime Material that hint at their strange origins. Nightmare traits are possible features that are revealed when you use the ability granted by your nightmare ancestry or when you are fully present on the Plane of Nightmares.</p><p>Players should be encouraged to take inspiration from the guise and nightmare traits provided to create their own unique and terrible visage.</p></section><p></p><h3>Heights</h3><p>You are crumbling cliff ledges and towering peaks. Free falls from unforgiving distances and careless slips from window sills. You are made from the dreams of those who fear heights more than anything else that the world has to offer, and as such, you cannot help but feel drawn to those same high places that are responsible for your emergence.</p><p><strong>Guise Traits:</strong> Tall, lanky, sharp features, high hairline.</p><p><strong>Nightmare Traits:</strong> Looming, extra joints, wind-blown garments, empty eye sockets.</p><p></p><h3>Pestilence</h3><p>You are sweating brow and retching stomach. Wounds turned septic, and eyes clouded by unchecked fever. You were born from the fear of disease and sickness witnessed by too many for too long. You are unphased by the presence of your origin and, instead, find yourself endlessly curious about how mortal bodies degenerate and decay.</p><p><strong>Guise Traits:</strong> Pallid, underweight, dark eye circles, wispy hair.</p><p><strong>Nightmare Traits:</strong> Gaunt, yellow eyes, plague masks, clouds of flies.</p><p></p><h3>Spiders</h3><p>You are clinging web and weeping fangs. Chittering mandibles and the predator’s gaze of far too many unblinking eyes. Your birth is tied to the terror inspired by arachnids, great and small. You find that you feel as at home among them as in any dining hall or tavern and never mind inviting one or two of your kin to any place you visit.</p><p><strong>Guise Traits:</strong> Long-limbed, large eyes, pronounced cuspids, coarse hair.</p><p><strong>Nightmare Traits:</strong> Many eyes, mandibles, spider legs, swarms of spiders.</p><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/thedark.png\" width=\"231\" height=\"326\" /><p></p><h3>The Dark</h3><p>You are endless void and crushing black. The haunting possibility of the waiting unseen and of nothing at all. You find your origins in the oldest of fears, of the darkness that hides unspeakable horrors or highlights unbearable emptiness. You wrap the blackest nights around yourself like a treasured cloak and find solace in places beyond the light’s reach.</p><p><strong>Guise Traits:</strong> Dark hair, grey pallor, black eyes, long shadow.</p><p><strong>Nightmare Traits:</strong> Featureless void, black tendrils, endless cloak, shifting size.</p><p></p><section id=\"secret-smRBSRuV4Jnp6P0o\" class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM NOTES: NEW CREATURE TYPE - NIGHTMARE</strong></p><p>The terrorborn (and the not deer featured later in this supplement) is an example of a new creature type present in the Underground Oracle campaign setting. Nightmares are terrifying beings brought to life by the fears of mortal dreaming and are most often defined by their ability to skew perception and steal hope and inspiration.</p><p>GMs who do not wish to introduce this new creature type into their games can consider relevant creatures aberrations.</p></section><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/terrorborn_edit.png\" width=\"271\" height=\"432\" /><p></p><h3>Terrorborn Traits</h3><p>Your lineage provides you with the following traits.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Increase. </strong>Increase one of your ability scores by 2 and a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</p><p><strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are a nightmare. You are also considered a humanoid for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be a humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size.</strong> You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you choose this lineage.</p><p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 90 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.</p><p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><strong>Blood of Fear.</strong> You are made of fear, and yet you do not feel it. You are immune to being frightened.</p><p><strong>Material Guise.</strong> Choose a lineage that doesn’t have a fly speed or swimming speed. You look as though you are a natural member of the chosen lineage. You do not gain any traits provided by the selected lineage.</p><p><strong>Nightmare Ancestry.</strong> As you adventure and your spark grows, your connection to your nightmare ancestry manifests in more powerful ways. At 3rd level, you gain one of the following traits based on the ancestry you chose above. If your selected trait requires a creature to make a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your Proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. Once you’ve used this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. When you reach 10th level, you may use this trait twice before needing a long rest.</p><p><strong>Vertigo (Heights Ancestry).</strong> As an action, you trap your foe on the towering peaks that jut from their subconscious. Choose a target creature within 30 feet of you that can see you. The target creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or its speed is reduced to 0, and it is frightened for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus. The target creature may repeat its saving throw at the start of each of its turns or immediately after taking damage. Once a creature has succeeded on its saving throw, it is no longer frightened, and its speed returns to normal.</p><p><strong>Plague Touch (Pestilence Ancestry).</strong> As a bonus action, you brush your fingers across a creature within 5 feet of you that can see you and pull the sickness they fear to the surface. The target creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be frightened for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus. While frightened in this way, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to twice your proficiency bonus. The target creature may repeat its saving throw at the start of each of its turns or immediately after taking damage. Once a creature has succeeded on its saving throw, it is no longer frightened, and its hit point maximum returns to normal.</p><p><strong>Swarm (Spiders Ancestry).</strong> As an action, you summon a swarm of crawling horrors from the mind of your victim. Choose a target creature within 30 feet of you that can see you. The target creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be frightened for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus. While frightened in this way, when the target creature starts its turn, it takes psychic damage equal to twice your proficiency bonus. The target creature may repeat its saving throw at the start of each of its turns or immediately after taking damage from any source other than your illusionary swarm. Once a creature has succeeded on its saving throw, it is no longer frightened, and your illusionary swarm disappears.</p><p><strong>Envelop (The Dark Ancestry).</strong> As an action, you draw the darkness from the nightmares of your adversaries and close it tightly around them. Choose a number of creatures within 30 feet of you equal to your proficiency bonus that can see you. The target creatures must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or they are blinded and frightened for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus. Affected creatures are still considered frightened by you despite the fact that they cannot see you. The target creatures may repeat their saving throws at the start of each of their turns or immediately after taking damage. Once a creature has succeeded on its saving throw, it is no longer frightened or blinded.</p><p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common, and one other language you and your GM agree is appropriate.</p><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Bardic College: College of the Curse Caller","type":"text","_id":"Sa5cXdOLXIXlSIfk","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p></p><blockquote><p>“In our darkest hours, the universe gifts us each a glorious melody.

Bards from the College of the Curse Caller spend their days composing songs whose somber beauty belies their terrible effects. These forlorn casters use their grim talents to stifle the luck and steal the inspiration of their enemies, making them easier for their allies to incapacitate.

This is a time that inspires both fear and trepidation, but these tales will protect us from Old Scarwood and his ilk. So long as the terror rings true.”</p><p>- Traditional start to the Warding of Pallowen</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Pallowen, known in some areas of the continent as the Frightful Harvest, is a yearly festival celebrated in honor of the last day of autumn. It acknowledges the blessings gained throughout the year and the role that both good and evil play in people's lives. It is a time to give thanks, but more importantly, it is a day of warding. Warding against not only the darkness of the season to come but also the nefarious creatures and evil spirits empowered during this transitional season.</p><p></p><h2><strong>A Druid’s Sacrifice</strong></h2><p>There are two central figures of the Pallowen festival—Pallowen, the brave halfling druid the holiday is named for, and Old Scarwood, a dark and twisted tree creature full of rot and malice. As the legend goes, a thousand years ago, the specter of a blighted druid tormented the people of the countryside, poisoning their crops and corrupting their forests. After many people valiantly tried and failed to stop the wicked spirit, a humble halfling druid answered the call of the woodlands that depended on her.</p><p>Pallowen battled the foul spirit, but the specter was powerful, more powerful than Pallowen by far. But the druid knew that if she didn’t stop this evil, it would continue to spoil and corrupt the lands she loved. So Pallowen cried out to her god of nature and channeled every bit of earthen energy she could muster from the ground beneath them and into the specter, destroying herself in the process. Her desperate gambit worked, but only partially. The specter could not be destroyed but was instead sealed within a great tree. Its essence merged completely with its wooden prison and has been trapped since that day.</p><p>However, according to the legend, there is one night a year when the spirit, now known as Old Scarwood, is free to roam the world again. The transition between the seasons when all evil is at its most powerful. The day that is now known as Pallowen.</p><p></p><h2><strong>A Festival in Parts</strong></h2><p>A holiday filled with food, costumes, dancing, and stories, Pallowen begins at first light and ends at first light the following day. The traditional celebration is separated into several distinct parts, each representing Pallowen’s battle with Scarwood, though it’s not uncommon for urban areas to focus more on the masquerade and treat-giving aspects of the holiday rather than its more conventional aspects.</p><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Festival_in_parts.png\" /><h1><strong>The Grace</strong></h1><p>The Grace of Pallowen begins at first light and is a time to recognize the bounties of life and the harvest. The community fasts while gathering to decorate and prepare the feast and treats for the day of celebration. Carved pumpkins and straw bales are placed around the community center, and streamers and banners are hung from every home and storefront as decadent cakes, candies, and pastries are made in overt abundance to accommodate the coming festivities.</p><p>When the sun is at its highest, the community breaks its fast and begins the Great Meal—a time for family, friends, and welcomed visitors to come together and show their gratitude for the good in their lives. It’s customary that each person at the table takes a turn to speak their thanks aloud and acknowledge the fruitful gains they’ve made over the season, generally while receiving jovial ribbing and teasing from the others around the table.</p><p></p><h1><strong>The Warding</strong></h1><p>The Warding of Pallowen starts as the feasting ends and the sun begins to hang low in the sky. It’s the time of the holiday to focus on fear and how to face it. It’s a commonly held belief that Pallowen marks the transition between autumn and winter, and that this transitionary period on the Prime Material plane is a time when evil creatures and spirits, led by Old Scarwood himself, are at their most active and powerful. To ward off the creatures of the night and stop them from bringing famineand disease to the community, the people gather together and tell scary stories or legends of great evil. These tales are always told in the first person, as though the speakers themselves were the ones causing the terrors from their stories. The tales are told in this manner to trick Old Scarwood and any other wandering evils into believing that the village has already been claimed by nefarious beings bragging about their conquests, and thus any other villains traveling through the night can continue their search for vulnerable villages.</p><p>The second half of The Warding is full of fun and celebration. Everyone puts on colorful costumes and gathers the treats prepared earlier in the day, placing them in a large Pallowen Basket at the center of the village. After the treats are gathered together, all of the children (and lighthearted adults), who have dressed themselves as various monsters, demons, and villains, begin their parade around the perimeter of the village, winding around the streets and houses and marching past the Pallowen Basket to collect treats wrapped in parchment and scrawled with blessings and prayers for the season to come. After the parade has ended, everyone gathers together for dancing and games, celebrating for as long as they can as midnight approaches.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Costumes and Twisted Tales</strong></h2><p>Although the subjects and fears are localized, dressing up as and telling stories of notorious villains and creatures is the central theme that remains unchanged no matter where Pallowen is celebrated on the continent. Known as a Pallowen Mask, these adopted personas are believed to ensure the safety and prosperity of the community throughout the long dark season to come.</p><p>The @UUID[RollTable.HE8mVvaQLF6hQFx1]{Pallowen Masks} table below provides examples of villainous creatures that are often the subjects of costumes and tales.</p><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Pallowen_Masks_Table.png\" /><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Costumes.png\" height=\"313\" /><p></p><h1><strong>The Sealing</strong></h1><p>The Sealing of Pallowen occurs at midnight and is the time meant to honor and recognize the druid Pallowen’s sacrifice and to protect the village and people during the hard season to come. Midnight on Pallowen—being not only the transition of one day to another but of one season into the next—is believed to be the most dangerous time of the year. As the celebrations and festivities come to a close, villagers giddily rush back to their homes, laughing and scrambling to collect the pieces of parchment containing the good omens and tidings that their neighbors festooned their treats in on the way. To end the evening, and provide the final act of protection for the season to come, they burn the pieces of parchment on the doorsteps of their homes, sending the good wishes and blessings into the ether to join the spirit of Pallowen herself.</p><p>After midnight, the evening is said to belong to the unsavory and wicked forces of the world, both corporeal and spiritual. The custom of staying indoors after the sealing is most strictly adhered to in more rural parts of the world, but within more urban areas it can often mark when the evening’s revelry is just hitting its stride. However, even in remote villages, there are always young and adventurous folk who see it as a test of mettle or a rebellious shirking of superstition to sneak outdoors and experience what the night holds for them.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Festival Activities</strong></h2><p>The activities and games to be experienced during Pallowen can change depending on the country and region where it’s being celebrated, but there are a few typical festivities that accompany nearly every version of the festival.</p><p></p><h3>Harvest Hunt</h3><p>The harvest hunt happens in corn mazes, along labyrinthian woodland trails, or through obstacle courses constructed from tall stacks of straw bales. A favorite seasonal game of the exuberant and athletic, participants take on the role of either hunter or prey, racing through the maze to either corner their quarry or escape the hands of their pursuer.</p><p>The harvest hunt takes place over 6 rounds. Participants playing the role of hunter enter the harvest maze 1 round after the prey. Each round, each prey makes a DC 14 Intelligence check to find their way through the maze. If they are touched by a hunter, they are captured and cannot complete the maze. Hunters touch prey by making a melee attack roll against the prey’s unarmored AC. Prey survives the hunt once they have made 6 successful Intelligence checks without being touched by a hunter. The hunters win if no prey makes it completely through the maze.</p><p></p><h3>Masquerade</h3><p>The masquerade is a gorgeous and lively affair whether it takes place around a bonfire or in an elegant ballroom. Partygoers wear their most elaborate costumes—with more metropolitan guests even enchanting their garb with illusions—and dance and celebrate until moments before The Sealing begins, at which point the Lord of the Masquerade is chosen. Chosen by applause and general audience uproar, the new Lord is presented with a small hawthorn crown and hoisted on the shoulders of their new court before being carried back to their home.</p><p>Over the course of the masquerade, participants may make a DC 14 Charisma check to impress their fellow partygoers and gain their support. On a successful check, the participant gains the support of 5 partygoers, or 10 partygoers if the check succeeds by 5 or more. On a failed check, the participant gains no support or loses the support of 5 partygoers if the check fails by 5 or more. At the end of the masquerade, the participant who has gained the support of the most partygoers is crowned the Lord of the Masquerade. In the event of a tie, the winner is determined by a final contested Charisma check.</p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Masquerade.jpg\" width=\"222\" height=\"397\" /><p></p><h3>Pumpkin Toss</h3><p>A staple of rural celebrations, the pumpkin toss is a Pallowen test of strength where participants gather up carved gourds from their position around the community and attempt to throw them onto tall wooden stakes. Generally started long after the cider and ale have been flowing for hours, the toss is often more of a mirthful act of pumpkin destruction than a true test of skill.</p><p>Participants have 3 chances to land a pumpkin on one of 3 wooden stakes, each painted a different color and set 15 feet apart from one another. Landing a pumpkin on the red stake requires a successful DC 13 Strength check and nets the participant 2 points. Landing a pumpkin on the purple stake requires a successful DC 15 Strength check and nets the participant 4 points. Landing a pumpkin on the gold stake requires a successful DC 17 Strength check and nets the participant 7 points. After the participants have each completed 3 tosses, the one with the most points is declared the winner.</p><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/pumpkintoss.png\" /><h3>Stilt Fight</h3><p>A test of balance and coordination, the stilt fight pits two people on colorful, ribbon-wrapped stilts against one another over a pool filled with autumn leaves—or any other festive, cushiony material. Although attempts to dislodge one another from their perch can lead to spirited scuffles, this contest always ends in laughter and good-humored teasing among the contestants.</p><p>Participants roll initiative at the start of each round. The participant with the highest initiative can attempt to knock over their opponent by making a Strength (Athletics) check contested by their opponent’s Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If a participant is overcome by their opponent, they can save themselves by succeeding on a DC 14 Dexterity check. Each time a participant must save themselves, the DC for their Dexterity check increases by 2. Once a participant has knocked over their opponent, they are declared the winner.</p><p></p><h3>Warding Parade</h3><p>The warding parade is the heart and soul of Pallowen and the activity most looked forward to by children celebrating the holiday. Not only does it provide the perfect opportunity to show off the costumes that the villagers worked on for weeks, but according to tradition, it also wards away any lingering evil spirits that might try to hide in the community. The fact that it culminates in pulling treats from the Pallowen Basket makes it all the sweeter.</p><p>The below<strong> @UUID[RollTable.r50vB2XZ8L7mohdP]{Pallowen Basket Treats}</strong> table provides examples of what might be pulled from the basket at the end of the warding parade and what blessings might be attached to them.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Plot Hooks</strong></h2><p>The following are plot hooks that you can use to stir up some adventure on Pallowen.</p><p>• While traveling through a great swamp, the party realizes that midnight has passed on Pallowen, and the ominous feeling of being followed settles upon them. The rush to make it back to civilization now begins. On the outskirts of a small hamlet, the group is approached by a terrified young child who tells them that her mother is going to be sacrificed by the locals in an attempt to drive off Old Scarwood.</p><p>• During the Warding of Pallowen, the sound of snapping trees and piercing screams suddenly interrupts the festivities as several blighted and rotten treants amble into the town square.</p><p>• While walking down the street, an unseen force suddenly lifts a small food cart and throws it through a tavern window. Screams can be heard from the building as people spill into the street still dressed in their Pallowen costumes.</p><p>• Raina Pamerra, a local lord, has asked that a nearby dungeon be emptied out before midnight on Pallowen. She fears the evil within will devastate the countryside if left unchecked during this dangerous season.</p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/pallowen_card.png\" width=\"198\" height=\"278\" /><h1><strong>Guilds &amp; Orders: The Order of the Sentinals</strong></h1><p></p><blockquote><p>“All for the cause. All for the realm. All against the darkness.”</p><p>- Order of the Sentinels creed</p></blockquote><p></p><p>The Order of the Sentinels is an ancient and secret society dedicated to protecting mortals from the supernaturally evil threats that work to escape the confines of their planes and wreak havoc on the Prime Material Plane. These brave guardians risk their own lives and souls to ensure that nothing sinister crosses the Veil between the planes and that those creatures that make it through are tracked down and destroyed.</p><p></p><h1><strong>The Darken Veil</strong></h1><p>The Darken Veil is the wall between the Prime Material Plane and all planes and pocket planes dedicated to evil, insanity, and decay. It’s an extraordinary magical barrier said to have been built by the gods as an extra measure of protection upon the existing Planar Veil that creates the gulf between creatures of the Prime Material and the various planes around them. Crossing the Veil between planes is incredibly difficult, but piercing the Darken Veil is nearly impossible for the malevolent forces of the cosmology. However, this layer of protection can be breached by mortals attempting to reach through and contact the powerful dark beings on the other side. Those mortals who willingly peer through the Darken Veil do so at the risk of their sanity, lives, and spirits, but the exchange of power they may receive is too great for them to forego. Each time these individuals reach through the Darken Veil, whether just deep enough to scry or to directly call upon an extraplanar servant, they weaken the barrier and run the risk of something more powerful and dire than they could imagine slipping through.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Malefic Ripples</strong></h2><p>One of the primary tenets among the Order of the Sentinels is that every great tragedy, every terrible event created by the forces of evil, can be traced to a single facilitating moment. These moments of contact with the dark planes, or Malefic Ripples as they’re called by the Order, leave impressions on the Darken Veil that can be found by those trained to sense them. Sentinels spend their time investigating and tracking down the sources of these Malefic Ripples, seeking to eliminate any potentially world-altering schemes in their infancy. Budding necromancers touching the Necrotic Plane, gathering occultists tampering with dark artifacts, warlocks turning to the void, or summoners reaching out for fiendish minions, are all targets of the Order of the Sentinels’ justice.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Who Joins</strong></h2><p>The Order of the Sentinels welcomes people from all walks of life into their ranks, although they specifically seek out and recruit those who have been the victims of the supernatural tragedies and traumas they seek to prevent. After months of investigation and observation, a potential recruit will be approached by a standing member of the order and invited to join their fight against the forces of darkness in any way they can. The members of the Order of the Sentinels are bakers, farmers, warriors, midwives, scholars, and politicians, but above all else, they are enemies of what lies beyond the Darken Veil.</p><p><em><strong>You will thrive in the Order of the Sentinels if:</strong></em></p><p>• You do not trust extraplanar forces or those who use them.</p><p>• You would lay down your life to protect the realm.</p><p>• You are willing to provide whatever you can in service of the cause.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Divisions of the Order</strong></h2><p>The Order of the Sentinels is a society of individuals who share a common goal and general mindset. Members are unpaid, although any wealth or treasure taken by the group is divided evenly among the chapter who found it, with the most wealthy members abstaining in favor of those less fortunate. Sentinels always provide for each other in whatever ways they can, whether it be a place to stay for the night, provisions for a mission to come, or using their political connections to facilitate an objective. The Order of the Sentinels has four divisions spread throughout the realm who work together to keep watch on the world around them and maintain the secrecy of their order.</p><p></p><h3>Sentries</h3><p>Although this is the simplest position in the order, it’s also considered the most important. This division is filled with locals who have few skills and hold humble positions within their communities. Sentries make up the largest numbers in the Order and are the primary source of information distribution among the members. They go about their daily lives as normal, and when they spot any signs of Malefic Ripples in the area, they immediately report this to their assigned contact and continue to watch and wait.</p><p></p><h3>Endowers</h3><p>This division is responsible for supplying the members of the Order of the Sentinels with what they need for their quests and missions for the order. They are usually merchants, outfitters, and blacksmiths of varying types who are well supplied with money and resources.</p><p></p><h3>Seekers</h3><p>This is the most dangerous division in the order. These are the warriors and field investigators who seek out the sources of Malefic Ripples that have been reported. Seekers are willing to do whatever must be done to stop those powers that would cause devastation to society, and that can often lead them down dangerous and illegal paths. Seekers must be careful of not only the dark forces they’re hunting, but of the local law enforcement and officials of the areas they’re in.</p><p></p><h3>Torchbearers</h3><p>Torchbearers are the leaders of the order and generally hold positions of power in their communities. Elders, politicians, and sages are all typically found in this division, and it’s their responsibility to organize and coordinate their local chapter of the Order of the Sentinels. These are the people responsible for removing bureaucratic roadblocks hindering the Order’s members, assigning missions, and clearing up any legal troubles that the Seekers may cause.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Goals</strong></h2><p>The goals of the Order of the Sentinels have remained unchanged since its founding: seek out those who would pierce the Darken Veil and destroy them before they can destroy the innocent mortal lives around them, hunt down any evil creatures who have broken through, and never let the life of one individual outweigh the lives of all.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Guild Features</strong></h2><p>The following options are available to PCs who join the Order of the Sentinels.</p><p></p><h3>Order of the Sentinels (Advanced Background)</h3><p>After surviving a terrible supernatural calamity, you were sought out by a member of the @UUID[Item.EfCqy6gnMufT06JP]{Order of the Sentinels}and recruited. You have completed your esoteric training with the Order and can now spot evidence of intrusion on the Darken Veil.</p><p></p><h3>Feature: Trace the Ripples</h3><p>You can sense and @UUID[Item.4ONcEfmMAu7tZhlO]{locate Malefic Ripples} . You may use Intelligence (Arcana) checks to track and determine the approximate time and location that something attempted to cross or communicate with any evil-aligned plane for up to 1 day after the contact or crossing was attempted.</p><p></p><h3>The Sentinel’s Light</h3><p>Wondrous Item, Major, Uncommon</p><p>This gorgeously crafted lantern is owned by all members of the Order of the Sentinels and kept carefully hidden away unless needed. To the uninitiated, The @UUID[Item.xRZodD4IEItqbZJl]{The Sentinel's Light} looks like a well-made and ornate adventurer’s lantern, but this mystical item is the most important tool in the Order’s arsenal.</p><p>The Sentinel’s Light has 3 charges, and regains all expended charges daily at sunrise. You may spend 1 charge to cast one of the spells below:</p><p>• <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.BP3GCwa66IAw1yTG]{Daylight}</em></p><p>• <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Mzh95utKDPIrjiH8]{Detect Evil and Good}</em></p><p>• <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.xmDBqZhRVrtLP8h2]{Protection from Evil and Good}</em></p><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Sentinels_Light.png\" width=\"184\" height=\"298\" /><p></p><h1><strong>Cults and Syndicates: The Broken Bone</strong></h1><p></p><blockquote><p>“He is the Ivory Chain! He is the Grinning Master! He is the Deathless Destruction! And we shall make him great again.”</p><p>— Lysba Valkin, cleric of Ecrassus</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Dominance, of not only a body but of a spirit. Control, of not only a life but of the death that comes after. That is what Ecrassus requires from his followers. That is what drives the cult of the Broken Bone.</p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Cults_Syndicates.jpg\" /><p></p><h2><strong>Break the Bones</strong></h2><p>Members of the Broken Bone live their lives in service of Ecrassus, God of the Skeletal Throng. Before he fell from power, Ecrassus ruled over a vast roaming army of skeletal undead that endlessly traversed the Necrotic Plane. A brutal and merciless god-king, Ecrassus commanded his followers to kill, conquer, and subjugate in the worst ways possible, and the worshippers of this fallen deity work to continue his legacy of violence and tyranny from their scattered factions around the continent.</p><p>The Broken Bone exists in small, generally uncoordinated pockets on the fringes of society, among evil tribes of barbarians, or in countries where the opportunity to practice necromancy or slavery without repercussion is available. Although anyone may be mad enough to be taken in by this abysmal sect, the most common followers are those who enjoy the power and dominance championed by this cult or those who have been victims of the same for long enough to become broken and evil themselves. The most common leaders of these cells are clerics, inspired by the nearly forgotten doctrine of Ecrassus and gifted visions from beyond the veil, or necromancers who see themselves in command of their own ivory horde one day. Despite their lack of formal organization, no matter where this cult begins to grow or who is leading them, their methods are fairly predictable, falling in line with the tenets of their malevolent god. And Ecrassus’s demands are as simple as they are immutable; to break the weak and claim all they have to offer. Or, as his followers often chant,</p><p><em><strong>“Break the bones, reap the marrow.”</strong></em></p><p></p><h2><strong>Reap the Marrow</strong></h2><p>Once they have their foothold in an area, the cult will begin scouting out areas to raid. Small villages and farms are particularly vulnerable at this stage, as they typically have the smallest means of resistance and offer the quickest way for the Broken Bone to swell their ranks. After successfully overtaking a village, they will enslave any survivors and begin their darkest works. The cult of the Broken Bone believes that in order to create a true skeletal throng, one that will return their master to his former glory, they cannot simply kill and then raise the remains of their victims. Instead, they combine their necromantic rites with forced labor, ritualistically working their new slaves to death, breaking both their bodies and spirits before adding their skeletons to their burgeoning army.</p><p>The cult will repeat this grisly cycle for as long as they can, attacking larger and larger settlements and growing their numbers until they draw the ire of a contingent strong enough to put an end to their reign of terror, or Ecrassus provides their leader with some new malignant directive.</p><p></p><section id=\"secret-zFKbkwVANK9Elox6\" class=\"secret\"><p><em><strong>GM NOTE:</strong></em></p><p><strong>For altercations with members of the cult of the Broken Bone, utilizing the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.CHEUjiYrVM9X0vIT]{Acolyte}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.B7lBOr1AahNZs4a6]{Archmage}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.kz1t6xeXVwODpYb2]{Berserker}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.tYfQIxCJT0WaaKmc]{Cult Fanatic}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.mQnsXanewsPiV7QE]{Mage}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.PVD5wRdyO7iCJPs1]{Priest}, or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.nREPw9g94Bsb9sIl]{Tribal Warrior} stat blocks would all be appropriate, depending on the flavor and difficulty of the encounter you're running.

An elaborate headdress made of melded bones, this grim artifact is coveted by his followers and provides them with all of the necrotic abilities they need to spread his sinister dogma.</p><p><strong>Random Properties.</strong> The Crown of Bone has the following random properties:</p><p>• 2 @UUID[RollTable.XSMUSA2l1oUbiZ6n]{major beneficial properties}</p><p>• 1 @UUID[RollTable.zY9TGvasG2D15znC]{major detrimental properties}</p><p><strong>Master of Skeletons.</strong> While you are attuned to the Crown of Bone, you can use an action to attempt to dominate any skeletal creatures that are not currently under your control.

With rumors of raiders growing in the area, and his desperation peaking, the wealthy merchant is willing to offer a fortune to any brave souls who can find her.</p><p>• News has come that Delk’s Peak has been completely overrun by savage barbarians. The few survivors who have managed to escape are telling tales of people being led away in chains and skeletal warriors running rampant.</p><p>• The people at the tavern are all abuzz about the madman who wandered into town overnight. He’s currently sitting in the local jail, ranting about the coming of “the ivory chain” and drawing incoherent scribbles in the dirt.</p><p>• A young acolyte of a local church has been having visions of an approaching skeletal army. No one has given their dreams much thought, but now that rumors of undead lurking in nearby ruins have reached the ears of the Bishop, she’s looking for a group to investigate.</p><p>• After a successful skirmish with a group of orcs, searching their bodies reveals a strange symbol made of human bone and a crudely drawn map to an apparent gathering place.</p><p></p><h1><strong>Infested: Parasites For Your Game</strong></h1><p></p><blockquote><p>“There are thousands of ways to die, millions if you’re really creative. I would take any of them over what did that.”</p><p>- Kinsey Stafford, Apprentice Field Medic</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Adventurers seem to have a habit of going to great lengths to put themselves where they don’t belong. Traversing far-off mountains, exploring dense jungles, or crossing shifting deserts means risking many dangers—both seen and unseen. And before any inexperienced party heads off into the great unknown, they’re often given words of warning and wisdom from their more experienced peers. Told in no uncertain terms that there are ravenous beasts, evil hordes, and supernatural monsters waiting to pounce in the wild places where adventurers are driven to explore, a fresh-faced group might feel emboldened by the knowledge that’s passed their way. But although knowing how to spot and avoid a massive danger will surely prolong the life of a traveling hero, sometimes the gravest threats these areas contain come in the smallest packages.</p><p></p><section id=\"secret-hGnQumUdo4m6MONS\" class=\"secret\"><p><em><strong>GM NOTE, Content Warning:</strong></em></p><p>This new game option introduces an element that some players may find too disturbing to enjoy.

Unless otherwise stated in a parasite’s description block, any spell or effect that detects disease or poison or ends disease or the poisoned condition will detect parasites or end the infested condition as well.</p><p>The effects of being infested are as follows:</p><p></p><h3>Infested</h3><p>• An infested creature has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws and Wisdom (Perception) checks.</p><p></p><h3>Effects</h3><p>In addition to the infested condition, most parasites cause unique effects that are detailed in their description block. The Effect section of a parasite’s block describes the duration, damage, and any other ramifications that an infestation from that parasite may cause.</p><p></p><h3>Becoming Infested</h3><p>Each parasite’s description block indicates how a creature becomes infested with that particular parasite by specifying whether it is external or internal. External parasites are typically contracted by passing through and coming into physical contact with an affected area or object. Internal parasites are generally contracted by a creature introducing the parasite into its system by drinking or eating contaminated materials or receiving an injury from some infested creatures.</p><p></p><h3>Detecting Parasites</h3><p>Parasites, like diseases and poisons, cannot be detected by nonmagical means, although a discerning character could make an appropriate skill check (Arcana, Nature, Medicine, or Survival) to realize the symptoms in another creature and tie them to the parasite in question. The DC for such checks should be determined by the GM as is appropriate to the circumstance.</p><p></p><h3>Harvesting</h3><p>Particularly adventurous characters may attempt to harvest parasites for later use. Should a character detect or discover a source of parasites, via magical or nonmagical means, they can follow the standard rules for harvesting poison to do so. Should they succeed in their necessary skill checks as determined by the GM, they can harvest one use of the parasite. If they fail, they are infested and subjected to the parasite’s effects as normal.</p><p></p><h3>Treatment</h3><p>Outside of spells or features that remove the infested condition from a creature, the most common way to remove parasites is through the use of an antiparasitic. Any character who has proficiency with an Herbalism Kit may create a single dose of a basic antiparasitic over the course of two hours if they have the necessary materials available.</p><p>It should be noted that anything that ends the infested condition on a creature will also end the effects of the parasite affecting them.</p><p></p><h3>Antiparasitic</h3><p>Adventuring Gear</p><p>30 gp</p><p>This @UUID[Item.7mapJQJk84QyOKfL]{potent tincture} provides a creature with advantage on saving throws against infestation for 1 hour or ends the infested condition in a currently affected creature.</p><p></p><p>Some parasites are more exotic, virulent, or magical than others and require one or more special materials in order to make an effective antiparasitic to prevent or treat their infestation. If special materials are necessary, they will be listed in the parasite’s description block.</p><p></p><h2><strong>New Parasites</strong></h2><p>The following are new parasites that you can introduce into your games. GMs should feel free to use the below as templates for creating their own parasites for later use, or to alter the saving throw DCs, durations, or descriptions of those provided to better fit their campaigns.</p><p></p><h3>Dream Eaters (Internal)</h3><p>Dream eaters are leech-like creatures that inhabit the sands of deserts and beaches. They spend most of their lives in hibernation among the dunes, only waking when they sense the presence of a warm-blooded creature in their vicinity. Those unfortunate enough to make camp among the dream eaters stir these parasites from their slumber, causing the worms to slowly climb from the sands and make their way up and into their victim’s ear canal. By the next morning, the throbbing pain in the affected creature’s ears, combined with the constant scritching of the dream eater’s movements, makes sleep and concentration nearly impossible.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Effect:</strong></p><p><strong>Dream eaters cause incessant pain and irritation in the ears of those they afflict. A creature subjected to this parasite must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.</strong></p><p><strong>On a successful save, the creature is infested for 2d12 hours.</strong></p><p><strong>On a failed save, the infestation lasts 2d4 days.</strong></p><p><strong>While infested, the creature has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration and cannot complete a long rest.</strong></p></blockquote><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Parasite1.png\" width=\"231\" height=\"328\" /><h3>Gorgon’s Kiss (Internal)</h3><p>Gorgon’s kiss are minute parasites that dwell on flowers and other vibrant flora, nesting among the pollen that the plants produce. As the wind carries the infested particles through the air, they’re inhaled by unlucky creatures passing through the clouds of spores, at which point the parasites begin their assault on their hosts’ bodies. As gorgon’s kiss moves through the infested creature, feasting on the blood flowing through their bodies, they excrete a substance that crystallizes and hardens, causing increasing amounts of pain and lethargy in their host. Allowed to go unchecked, the victims of gorgon’s kiss are left completely petrified by the crystals throughout their body.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Effect:</strong></p><p><strong>Gorgon’s kiss causes lethargy, pain, and eventual petrification in those they infest. A creature that contracts this parasite must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw.</strong></p><p><strong>On a failed save, it is infested and immediately gains 1 level of exhaustion. Exhaustion gained by gorgon’s kiss cannot be removed while the afflicted creature is infested.</strong></p><p><strong>Every 4 hours, the infested creature must repeat its saving throw.</strong></p><p><strong>On a failure, it takes 2d6 slashing damage. While infested, if the afflicted creature fails 3 saving throws, they become restrained. After failing 6 total saving throws, the infested creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.</strong></p></blockquote><p></p><h3>Hermit Hounds (Internal)</h3><p>Hermit hounds are thin, translucent worms that are found infesting the waters and wildlife of forested areas. Incredibly difficult to see, they’re most commonly encountered by novice adventurers and careless woodsmen who improperly prepare game or drink water tainted with the parasite. After infestation, hermit hounds cause a noticeable change in the personality of their host, making them prone to irritation and paranoia and driving them to become more and more isolated. Once driven into seclusion in the wilderness, the host most typically falls victim to another wild animal or creature that the hermit hounds then pass on to.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Effect:</strong></p><p><strong>Hermit hounds cloud the mind and dull their host’s personality. A creature that drinks water or eats food contaminated with this parasite must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw.</strong></p><p><strong>On a failed save, the creature is infested for 1d10 days and has disadvantage on all Charisma saving throws and ability checks, avoiding the effects on a success.</strong></p></blockquote><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Parasite2.png\" width=\"232\" height=\"171\" /><p></p><h3>Storm Mites (External)</h3><p>Storm mites are aquatic arthropods roughly the size and shape of a copper piece. In most circumstances, these creatures remain in the shallow tidal pools where they’re born without ever coming into contact with people. However, during periods of monsoons and flooding, minuscule storm mite larvae are swept inland where they burrow under the skin of anyone they touch, creating excruciating clusters of boils and making it almost impossible to wear anything heavier than a loose tunic. After incubating within their host, the mature mites burst out of their host’s flesh, causing even more pain and trauma to their victim’s body.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Effect:</strong></p><p><strong>Storm mites burrow into the skin, causing painful and grotesque boils where they gather. A creature that comes into contact with this parasite must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.</strong></p><p><strong>On a failed save, the creature is infested for 1d6 days while the mites incubate. During this period, the pustules caused by the incubating mites make wearing light, medium, or heavy armor impossible. At the end of their incubation period, the mites burst from their host's skin, causing 3d4 piercing damage.</strong></p></blockquote><p></p><h3>Wraith Kin (External)</h3><p>Wraith kin are tiny, transparent jellies that dwell in caves and dank dungeons throughout the realms. They wait on floors, walls, and ceilings in a dormant state until a living creature passes near them, rousing them from their slumber, at which point they attach themselves to their host's flesh. The impact of the wraith kin can be noticed immediately on their host, who finds themself suddenly depleted of their vitality and life force. Given their near-invisible bodies and the draining effects they have on those they infest, they are rumored to be a type of undead, though this is yet to be proven.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Effect:</strong></p><p><strong>Wraith kin attach to their host’s flesh, leeching their energy and spirit. A creature whose flesh comes into contact with wraith kin must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.</strong></p><p><strong>On a failed save, the creature becomes infested for 2d6 days, or avoiding the effect on a success.</strong></p><p><strong>While infested, the creature’s hit point maximum is reduced by 4d4.</strong></p></blockquote><p></p><h2><strong>Infesting Spells</strong></h2><p>The following are new infesting spells characters can use to pass along the unwelcome pains of parasites or GMs can use to fill in the spellbooks of their insidious NPCs.</p><p></p><blockquote><p>@UUID[Item.EWGZKXbWNAZejaje]{Infesting Grasp}</p><p>1st-level conjuration</p><p>Casting Time: 1 action</p><p>Range: Touch</p><p>Components: V, S</p><p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>You reach out and clutch a target creature, summoning the virulent might of nature’s tiniest terrors. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 piercing damage and is infested. At the start of each of their turns for the duration, the infested creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take an additional 1d8 piercing damage. On a success, the effect ends on that creature, and they are no longer infested.</p><p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.</p><p>Classes: druid, ranger</p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p>@UUID[Item.Uf9u64Dq73nmEhZy]{Cloak of Grotesque Multitudes}</p><p>2nd-level conjuration</p><p>Casting Time: 1 action</p><p>Range: Self</p><p>Components: V, S</p><p>Duration: 1 Hour</p><p>You bite back your revulsion and cover your body with a swarm of parasites that disgusts your opponents and confuses their strikes. Each time a creature targets you with a melee attack during the spell's duration, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target creature’s attack misses you, and they instead take 1d6 piercing damage and become infested. On a success, the creature’s attack continues as normal.</p><p>This spell ends when your saving throw is failed three times or when you dismiss it as an action. While this spell is active, you have disadvantage on all Charisma-based skill checks but Intimidation.</p><p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the number of saving throw failures that can be experienced before the spell ends increases by 1 for each slot level above 2nd.</p><p>Classes: druid, ranger, warlock</p></blockquote><p></p><h2><strong>Creature Features</strong></h2><p>The following are a few example features GMs can apply to existing creatures to allow them to access and utilize the rules for parasites presented in this supplement.</p><p></p><p><em><strong>Master of Plagues.</strong></em> When the [name of creature] successfully damages a creature with a spell, the damaged creature must make an additional Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature has disadvantage on saving throws made to resist being diseased, infested, or poisoned. This effect lasts until the affected creature completes a long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Revolting Body.</strong></em> When a creature within 30 feet of the [name of creature] targets it with an attack, the attacking creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or that creature cannot select the [name of creature] as the target of their attack.</p><p><em><strong>Teeming.</strong></em> A creature that touches the [name of creature] or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 piercing damage and become infested. A creature that has already been infested by this feature does not take additional damage from subsequent activations of this feature.</p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Creature_Feature_Image.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /><p></p><h1><strong>Heprion's Guide: Legendary Cursed Items</strong></h1><p></p><blockquote><p>“I’ve spent my life cataloging treasures with extraordinary properties.

A tale told by road-weary travelers to entertain tavern goers and encourage the flow of free ale.

Given their incredibly chaotic and bloodthirsty natures, black-eyed children are one of the least reliable demons to summon, using any tricks or avenues available to them to break free from their masters and run rampant on the Prime Material. While on the Lower Planes, black-eyed children spend their time plotting and searching for ways to get to the Prime Material.

The terrible clattering of hooves cutting through the still night air. The ghastly inevitability of what this creature of retribution carries with it in its loathsome carriage.

Sent from beyond the realms of mortal men to bring retribution from vengeful gods or otherworldly beings, once a dread coachman has been tasked with a bounty, they cannot return to their masters empty-handed. There is no stretch of the Prime Material that their victims could go where the dread coachman would not find them. Once they have discovered their target, they make their intentions known by calling out their name and their crimes in a voice that resonates within the chests of all who can hear it. After that, it’s only a matter of time before they're within the dark oblivion of the dread coachman’s carriage, never to be seen again.</p><p>Not even death can dissuade the dread coachman, as it’s sometimes sent to gather lost souls wandering through the planes to bring them in for their final judgments, especially those that led dark lives and have failed to move on to their gods.</p><p>Through the popularity of the folklore surrounding it, this particular wraith has gained a reputation for bringing evil men to meet their ultimate justice, but the truth is a far grimmer matter. The dread coachman is an amoral creature, only capable of carrying out the acts of revenge directed to it by its master, whether those commands are truly just or not. Villain or hero, guilty or innocent, once their taskmaster has delivered their judgment, the dread coachman can only obey.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Broken Bonds</strong></h2><p>The dread coachman’s imprisonment to the whims of their master begins at their creation, which occurs when the follower or servant of a god or other immortal betrays their sacred covenant. Regardless of whether the betrayal was purposeful or inadvertent, the punishment is the same; an infinity of horrid servitude.</p><p>There are rare circumstances when the bonds between a dread coachman and their commander are severed, usually through planar events or powerful artifactual magic. When this happens, the creature begins to rot and is driven entirely into darkness, harvesting as many souls as it can and growing in power and maliciousness until it is finally driven from the plane. Or, in the worst instances, until it is bound to a more nefarious source on the Prime Material.</p><p></p><section id=\"secret-ac3hMr3R0dhGAylm\" class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM NOTES: WHIP OF SORROWS</strong></p><p>When a dread coachman is defeated, they’re driven back to their plane of origin, leaving behind their primary weapon, the whip of all sorrows.</p><p>@UUID[Item.u5r4IJerJxl91gsz]{Whip of All Sorrows}</p><p><strong>Whip of All Sorrows</strong></p><p>Weapon (Whip), Rare (Requires Attunement)</p><p>This ghoulish whip is made from the polished bones of a multitude of different humanoids and ends in a cruel barb.</p><p>While attuned to this whip, you have resistance to necrotic damage, and this weapon does an additional 2d8 necrotic damage.</p></section><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/dread_coachman.png\" /><p></p><h2><strong>Plot Hooks</strong></h2><p>The following are plot hooks you can use to introduce or interact with this new creature:</p><p>• “Call the guards! The bloody coachman is here for me, and I’ve done nothing wrong!” As the dread coachman passes through the house the woman ran out of, cold air hits you, and the smell of putrid death comes along with it.</p><p>• You’re stopped by the local sheriff as you pass her building. She tells you that she’s noticed how you hold yourself and how well-armed you are and says she’s looking for assistance. “A flying carriage has been seen over the past few weeks, and each time it’s reported, people come up missing. Could you help us find out what’s happening?”.</p><p>• As you’re walking down the road, you suddenly hear your name being called out. It echoes in the air and reverberates through your chest. “Your name has been given, and I have come to collect your soul!”</p><p>• After traveling through the mountains for some time, you come upon a strange carriage with a missing wheel. From behind it, a voice calls out, “Do not fear me, for I have not come for you. The one I seek has done much evil against both humanity and the gods.” A hideous coachman steps from behind the carriage and continues speaking. “But I could use your assistance.”</p><p>• As you stop in the city, you see a post that reads, “Only the brave should apply.

They are revenants seeking themselves. Tasked to roam the unhallowed woods, forever seeking their own kin.”</p><p>~ Egress Varn, High Priest of the Eternal Ember Temple</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Tales of what punishments befall mortals who break the sanctity of enchanted lands are plentiful. Hunters who mark a sacred beast as their prey. Woodsmen who fell the wrong tree in a grove. Guardians of the earthen realms who fail their lords in their solemn duties. All must pay a price in order to prevent future transgressions from their kind. But none have paid so heavily as the ones they call the bunny men.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Cursed Guardians</strong></h2><p>Bunny men are hulking, malevolent creatures, cursed by fey or similar otherworldly beings for perceived trespasses against the flora and fauna within their domains. A cruel amalgam of hare and humanoid, bunny men are stripped of any mercy, benevolence, or reason that they once possessed and doomed to act as guardians in the lands that they offended, hunting down and eliminating anyone foolish or careless enough to wander into the territories they’ve been loosed upon.</p><p>Typically cursed and created by evil fey, bunny men are highly valued by deep woods hags and their adjacent ilk for both their bloodthirsty natures and ceaseless capabilities. Along with any thread of goodness that once remained in the wretched creatures, bunny men are deprived of their ability to sleep or rest, instead tasked with endlessly searching and surveying the lands of their masters for any potential threats or victims they might find there. A fell combination of finely-honed skill and bequeathed magics, bunny men are master hunters. Perfectly suited to force their way through any obstacle or hindrance set before them, once a bunny man has sighted their prey, they cannot stop their pursuit until either they or their target has been returned to the dark soil.</p><p>The bunny men’s tool of choice for their grim business is the same no matter what their long-forgotten origins may have been — a woodsmen’s axe, larger and sharper than any that they would have wielded in their past life and dripping with steady rivulets of blood that seep from the head of the weapon itself. It’s said that with every drop of blood that falls from their axe, another piece of who they once were is lost to the ether. Whether or not that is true, in the rare moments that a bunny man gains some small semblance of lucidity, it comes as more curse than blessing.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Bloodsoaked Relief</strong></h2><p>When a bunny man has achieved their singular goal, their axe slick with blood brought from outside of the woods they are forsaken to protect, they’re allowed a brief moment of bittersweet rest. Standing among the remains of the lives they snuffed out, their muscles go slack, their mind slows, and they lose themselves to whatever place these tortured and tortuous creatures go in these scarce moments. In this trance-like state, the bunny man remembers. Remembers who they once were, what events led them to their cursed shape and the many wicked things they have been charged to do since then. And, in the face of the infinite sadness of that tiny moment, they remember how to scream. It’s during this time that truly vicious and vengeful creators might visit their inconsolable warden, making promises of an eventual release from their curse and reinstatement of the life they lost before committing their terrible crimes against the earthen realm. These are, of course, lies and further cruelties that the bunny man will forget by sunrise. On the rare occasion that a bunny man has outlived their usefulness to their master, they are turned wholly into a hare. Fulfilling the fey’s darkest sense of humor and finally making the full transformation from predator to prey.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Harvestable Materials:</strong></h2><p></p><h3><strong>Bunny Man’s Axe</strong></h3><p>@UUID[Item.qYTqJsseiV0YyH35]{Bunny Man's Axe}</p><p><em><strong>Weapon (Greataxe), Rare (Requires Attunement)</strong></em></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p><p>When you roll a maximum result on the damage die for an attack you make with this axe, the target creature must make a Constitution saving throw whose DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.

It wasn’t any deer.”</p><p>- Allendon Mayersiel, ranger of Gillshire</p></blockquote><p></p><p>All creatures dream. From the snakes slithering their way through the underbrush, to the owls roosted high in the hollows of maple trees, to the squirrels that get caught by either somewhere in between. The particulars that make up the wild dreamscapes that these beasts roam are unknown to most, but it’s their nightmares that mortals must be wary of. When the creatures of the woods touch that dread plane in unison, in the face of a threat to them all, the nightmares they produce can be made flesh and bone. Nightmares that almost reflect their own kind. Nightmares like the not deer.</p><p></p><section id=\"secret-gOx6Qvetxt17cxkj\" class=\"secret\"><p><em><strong>GM NOTES: OPHCIPHAEL, THE PLANE OF NIGHTMARES</strong></em></p><p>In the cosmology of Quaseloth, the Underground Oracle campaign setting, Ophciphael is a shifting plane of nightmares created when a vengeful celestial being destroyed itself to punish the sins of mortals.</p></section><p></p><h2><strong>Unnatural Response</strong></h2><p>Not deer are denizens of Ophciphael, the Plane of Nightmares. Created by the coalesced fear and mental anguish of groups of creatures crying out together in their dreams, these monstrous beings are an unnatural response to equally unnatural threats faced by the forest. Arcane disasters blighting the land, clearcutting and razing to make way for the progress of humanity, stygian energies oozing from a tear in the planes that corrupts the natural order. Any of these events could give rise to a not deer.</p><p>Although given form on Ophciphael, not deer cannot physically manifest on the Prime Material without first being born. Entering the womb of a pregnant doe through the dreams of her unborn, the not deer waits, slowly draining the life from one of the unfortunate fawns within and eventually taking its place alongside its sibling. The resulting labor is a bloody and loathsome affair that encapsulates the trauma and turmoil that gave the creature its very essence. After its true birth, the not deer rises from the gore-slicked ground on too-steady legs with too many joints and takes its place among its new family.</p><p>Despite their wholly unnatural and unsettling presence, the creatures the not deer surrounds themselves with do not appear to notice or care about their newest herd member’s physical or behavioral irregularities. Like all nightmares, the not deer is an inherently insidious creature, able to twist and manipulate the perceptions of those around it so only the most enchanted beast or earthen creature would be able to discern its true nature. The not deer assumes an adult form overnight and, after driving any competing bucks or predators in the area to destroy themselves in fits of froth-spitting rage and frenzy, takes its place at the center of the herd. And it begins to feed.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Fear Eater</strong></h2><p>Not deer consume the psychic energy of living creatures around them, siphoning their discomfort, fear, and pain to sustain themselves. Although the beasts of the forest offer little in the way of intelligence, in large enough numbers, the not deer can still gorge itself without fully depleting its food source. Perfectly willing to disrupt the natural order, the not deer will lead its herd into disease, famine, and catastrophe so that it might enjoy a heartier meal while remaining careful not to let the bulk of its resources succumb to their circumstances. Not deer will even go so far as to assist in whatever disaster created it if it’s able, or at the very least, keep anyone from attempting to remedy the situation.</p><p>When faced with an intelligent threat, the not deer will employ the same mind-clouding methods and eldritch subterfuge it does on the beasts around it, but instead of savoring this new meal it will seek to fully consume and destroy the mind of its foe as soon as is possible. Unwilling to let its presence be known for risk of being ejected from the plane, the not deer will use every tool in its nightmarish arsenal to protect itself and destroy its enemies, including calling on its false family to defy their instincts and viciously attack its adversaries.</p><p></p><h2 data-anchor=\"harvestable-materials:\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:1rem 0px 0.5rem;padding:0px;font-weight:normal;font-size:1.5em;border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header);color:rgb(25, 24, 19);font-family:Signika, sans-serif;font-style:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">Harvestable Materials:</strong></span></h2><p></p><h3><strong>Not Deer Antler</strong></h3><p>@UUID[Item.yJv3c49Te8sya8ef]{Not Deer Antler}</p><p>When it is destroyed, the not deer is shunted back to the Plane of Nightmares, leaving behind a rancid-smelling puddle of dark purple ooze and a single piece of antler.</p><p><em><strong>Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)</strong></em></p><p>This antler can be used as a spellcasting focus.

But where did I find myself on the evening? Guarding a caravan of wine and silks and praying to the gods I made it to morning. Those white devils trailed us for miles. Weaving in and out of the trees and vanishing from sight in a blink. Until the day I die, I’ll remember those howls. But not nearly as clearly as Jonathan’s screams as they drug him into the night.”</p><p>~ From the report of Falen Cooper, transport guard</p></blockquote><p></p><p>While traveling through the wilds or on vacant trails along towering woods, a noisy night can be a true blessing. The sounds of animals filling the air may be disconcerting to people better acquainted with life inside city walls than without, but for well-worn travelers, the sounds of nature are the sounds of normalcy. It’s the still nights that are truly terrifying. When the wind seems nervous to come as more than a whisper and the moonless sky hangs heavy and stifling overhead. It’s on those nights the true monsters are about, waiting to pierce that unnatural silence with their ragged, shrieking howls.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Monstrous Bloodline</strong></h2><p>White things resemble many-limbed wolves the size of bears. They roam far and wide through their wooded territories, perpetually trying to sate their nearly endless lust for rending and feasting on flesh and bone. Consummate killers, white things will gladly tear their way through herds of prey animals or even apex predators foolish enough to see the white things as nothing more than rival beasts. But although their environments are flush with creatures ripe for the picking, the white things are always drawn back to the source of their first taste of blood.</p><p>Before they were the terrible beings they are today, the first white things were a different sort of monster altogether. A small family of nobles known for their heavy-handed handling of the people under their banner and the battle￾hungry way they acquired new territory around their lands, they were as fierce as they were cold and cared only for those that shared their bloodline. They had been skirmishing for months with a small group of resistance fighters in the hills of their newest territory when the matriarch of the noble family had finally had enough. Leading the charge herself with her children beside her, they razed the hillside without any regard for the people there, eventually forcing the leaders of the resistance to turn themselves over in an attempt to stop the wanton violence.</p><p>As the leaders of the resistance stood bound on the gallows, the gloating matriarch allowed them to say their final words before sending them on to oblivion. The eldest of the resistance, a man whose back bent double under the weight of the years he carried, stepped forward and used his dying words to cry out a curse, begging his god to reveal these devil’s dogs as the monsters they truly were. And as the old man’s rope went taut, it punctuated his prayer with a sound like a thunderclap that was said to be heard for miles before settling into an unnatural silence. The air then filled with the shrieking howls of the matriarch and her noble family and the desperate cries of their men.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Silent Night</strong></h2><p>After tearing their soldiers to unrecognizable shreds, the white things abandoned their realm for woodlands that suited their new forms and hungers, spreading through the darkest woodlands over the centuries that followed and terrorizing travelers foolish enough to brave the night. When the moon is new, white things slip silently through the forest and along roadsides, fading in and out of the trees like a fog and trailing unsuspecting parties until the perfect time to strike. What they may lack in the intelligence their ancestors once possessed, the white things make up for with bestial instinct, flesh-rending claws, and the ability to seemingly fade into and out of thin air when they please.</p><p>It’s said that when the white things are on the prowl, the night goes dead silent, as though the entire world and all of the living things in it were holding their breath. Seasoned caravaners and travelers know to be wary when the night gets too quiet and to prepare for the white things to come. But the truly wise know that when their shrieking howls cut through the night air, it’s already too late.</p><p></p><h2 data-anchor=\"harvestable-materials:\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:1rem 0px 0.5rem;padding:0px;font-weight:normal;font-size:1.5em;border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header);color:rgb(25, 24, 19);font-family:Signika, sans-serif;font-style:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">Harvestable Materials:</strong></span></h2><p></p><h3><strong>Pelt of the White Thing</strong></h3><p>@UUID[Item.ZBBOQUMNPq6u5ZJC]{Pelt of the White Thing}</p><p>When a white thing is killed, it falls to the ground the same way as any natural animal, and although its pelt can be harvested from its carcass, there is nothing natural about it.</p><p><em><strong>Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)</strong></em></p><p>Your Dexterity and Strength each increase by 2 (the pelt may increase these scores above 20), and you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't silvered.</p><p>While wearing this pelt, you can transform your hands into savage claws to make an unarmed strike as a bonus action.

Some terrorborn understand their origins entirely and find themselves strangely delighted by their new form of existence. Others suffer in confusion, lost in the ill-fitting memories of an identity that was never meant to be theirs. In either case, the terrorborn often find themselves drawn to a life of adventure.

You are also considered a humanoid for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be a humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size.</strong> You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you choose this lineage.</p><p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 90 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.</p><p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><strong>Blood of Fear.</strong> You are made of fear, and yet you do not feel it. You are immune to being frightened.</p><p><strong>Material Guise.</strong> Choose a lineage that doesn’t have a fly speed or swimming speed. You look as though you are a natural member of the chosen lineage. You do not gain any traits provided by the selected lineage.</p><p><strong>Nightmare Ancestry.</strong> As you adventure and your spark grows, your connection to your nightmare ancestry manifests in more powerful ways. At 3rd level, you gain one of the following traits based on the ancestry you chose above. If your selected trait requires a creature to make a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your Proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. Once you’ve used this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. When you reach 10th level, you may use this trait twice before needing a long rest.</p><p><strong>Vertigo (Heights Ancestry).</strong> As an action, you trap your foe on the towering peaks that jut from their subconscious. Choose a target creature within 30 feet of you that can see you. The target creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or its speed is reduced to 0, and it is frightened for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus. The target creature may repeat its saving throw at the start of each of its turns or immediately after taking damage. Once a creature has succeeded on its saving throw, it is no longer frightened, and its speed returns to normal.</p><p><strong>Plague Touch (Pestilence Ancestry).</strong> As a bonus action, you brush your fingers across a creature within 5 feet of you that can see you and pull the sickness they fear to the surface. The target creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be frightened for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus. While frightened in this way, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to twice your proficiency bonus. The target creature may repeat its saving throw at the start of each of its turns or immediately after taking damage. Once a creature has succeeded on its saving throw, it is no longer frightened, and its hit point maximum returns to normal.</p><p><strong>Swarm (Spiders Ancestry).</strong> As an action, you summon a swarm of crawling horrors from the mind of your victim. Choose a target creature within 30 feet of you that can see you. The target creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be frightened for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus. While frightened in this way, when the target creature starts its turn, it takes psychic damage equal to twice your proficiency bonus. The target creature may repeat its saving throw at the start of each of its turns or immediately after taking damage from any source other than your illusionary swarm. Once a creature has succeeded on its saving throw, it is no longer frightened, and your illusionary swarm disappears.</p><p><strong>Envelop (The Dark Ancestry).</strong> As an action, you draw the darkness from the nightmares of your adversaries and close it tightly around them. Choose a number of creatures within 30 feet of you equal to your proficiency bonus that can see you. The target creatures must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or they are blinded and frightened for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus. Affected creatures are still considered frightened by you despite the fact that they cannot see you. The target creatures may repeat their saving throws at the start of each of their turns or immediately after taking damage. Once a creature has succeeded on its saving throw, it is no longer frightened or blinded.</p><p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common, and one other language you and your GM agree is appropriate.</p><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Bardic College: College of the Curse Caller","type":"text","_id":"Sa5cXdOLXIXlSIfk","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p></p><blockquote><p>“In our darkest hours, the universe gifts us each a glorious melody.

As an action, choose a number of creatures within 30 feet of you equal to your proficiency bonus. The chosen creatures’ shadows separate from them and begin to attack them viciously. The creatures must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature’s speed is halved, and they take 4d8 force damage from their shadows. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and their speed is not affected. The shadows continue to rebel and slow the affected creatures for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one). Affected creatures may repeat their saving throws at the start of each of their turns.

As an action, choose a number of creatures within 60 feet of you equal to your proficiency bonus that can see and hear you. The chosen creatures must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is either charmed or frightened for 1 minute.

Although their earthen magics are often effective in the pursuit of their incorporeal foes, a Veil Watchman will utilize any tools and techniques necessary to safeguard mortals. Alchemy, divine blessings, esoteric tomes, and arcane artifacts—attained legally or illicitly—are all equal parts of their ghost hunting arsenal. This willingness to experiment leads them to ally themselves with an assortment of churches, secret societies, and guilds.

This is a time that inspires both fear and trepidation, but these tales will protect us from Old Scarwood and his ilk. So long as the terror rings true.”</p><p>- Traditional start to the Warding of Pallowen</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Pallowen, known in some areas of the continent as the Frightful Harvest, is a yearly festival celebrated in honor of the last day of autumn. It acknowledges the blessings gained throughout the year and the role that both good and evil play in people's lives. It is a time to give thanks, but more importantly, it is a day of warding. Warding against not only the darkness of the season to come but also the nefarious creatures and evil spirits empowered during this transitional season.</p><p></p><h2><strong>A Druid’s Sacrifice</strong></h2><p>There are two central figures of the Pallowen festival—Pallowen, the brave halfling druid the holiday is named for, and Old Scarwood, a dark and twisted tree creature full of rot and malice. As the legend goes, a thousand years ago, the specter of a blighted druid tormented the people of the countryside, poisoning their crops and corrupting their forests. After many people valiantly tried and failed to stop the wicked spirit, a humble halfling druid answered the call of the woodlands that depended on her.</p><p>Pallowen battled the foul spirit, but the specter was powerful, more powerful than Pallowen by far. But the druid knew that if she didn’t stop this evil, it would continue to spoil and corrupt the lands she loved. So Pallowen cried out to her god of nature and channeled every bit of earthen energy she could muster from the ground beneath them and into the specter, destroying herself in the process. Her desperate gambit worked, but only partially. The specter could not be destroyed but was instead sealed within a great tree. Its essence merged completely with its wooden prison and has been trapped since that day.</p><p>However, according to the legend, there is one night a year when the spirit, now known as Old Scarwood, is free to roam the world again. The transition between the seasons when all evil is at its most powerful. The day that is now known as Pallowen.</p><p></p><h2><strong>A Festival in Parts</strong></h2><p>A holiday filled with food, costumes, dancing, and stories, Pallowen begins at first light and ends at first light the following day. The traditional celebration is separated into several distinct parts, each representing Pallowen’s battle with Scarwood, though it’s not uncommon for urban areas to focus more on the masquerade and treat-giving aspects of the holiday rather than its more conventional aspects.</p><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Festival_in_parts.png\" /><h1><strong>The Grace</strong></h1><p>The Grace of Pallowen begins at first light and is a time to recognize the bounties of life and the harvest. The community fasts while gathering to decorate and prepare the feast and treats for the day of celebration. Carved pumpkins and straw bales are placed around the community center, and streamers and banners are hung from every home and storefront as decadent cakes, candies, and pastries are made in overt abundance to accommodate the coming festivities.</p><p>When the sun is at its highest, the community breaks its fast and begins the Great Meal—a time for family, friends, and welcomed visitors to come together and show their gratitude for the good in their lives. It’s customary that each person at the table takes a turn to speak their thanks aloud and acknowledge the fruitful gains they’ve made over the season, generally while receiving jovial ribbing and teasing from the others around the table.</p><p></p><h1><strong>The Warding</strong></h1><p>The Warding of Pallowen starts as the feasting ends and the sun begins to hang low in the sky. It’s the time of the holiday to focus on fear and how to face it. It’s a commonly held belief that Pallowen marks the transition between autumn and winter, and that this transitionary period on the Prime Material plane is a time when evil creatures and spirits, led by Old Scarwood himself, are at their most active and powerful. To ward off the creatures of the night and stop them from bringing famineand disease to the community, the people gather together and tell scary stories or legends of great evil. These tales are always told in the first person, as though the speakers themselves were the ones causing the terrors from their stories. The tales are told in this manner to trick Old Scarwood and any other wandering evils into believing that the village has already been claimed by nefarious beings bragging about their conquests, and thus any other villains traveling through the night can continue their search for vulnerable villages.</p><p>The second half of The Warding is full of fun and celebration. Everyone puts on colorful costumes and gathers the treats prepared earlier in the day, placing them in a large Pallowen Basket at the center of the village. After the treats are gathered together, all of the children (and lighthearted adults), who have dressed themselves as various monsters, demons, and villains, begin their parade around the perimeter of the village, winding around the streets and houses and marching past the Pallowen Basket to collect treats wrapped in parchment and scrawled with blessings and prayers for the season to come. After the parade has ended, everyone gathers together for dancing and games, celebrating for as long as they can as midnight approaches.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Costumes and Twisted Tales</strong></h2><p>Although the subjects and fears are localized, dressing up as and telling stories of notorious villains and creatures is the central theme that remains unchanged no matter where Pallowen is celebrated on the continent. Known as a Pallowen Mask, these adopted personas are believed to ensure the safety and prosperity of the community throughout the long dark season to come.</p><p>The @UUID[RollTable.HE8mVvaQLF6hQFx1]{Pallowen Masks} table below provides examples of villainous creatures that are often the subjects of costumes and tales.</p><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Pallowen_Masks_Table.png\" /><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Costumes.png\" height=\"313\" /><p></p><h1><strong>The Sealing</strong></h1><p>The Sealing of Pallowen occurs at midnight and is the time meant to honor and recognize the druid Pallowen’s sacrifice and to protect the village and people during the hard season to come. Midnight on Pallowen—being not only the transition of one day to another but of one season into the next—is believed to be the most dangerous time of the year. As the celebrations and festivities come to a close, villagers giddily rush back to their homes, laughing and scrambling to collect the pieces of parchment containing the good omens and tidings that their neighbors festooned their treats in on the way. To end the evening, and provide the final act of protection for the season to come, they burn the pieces of parchment on the doorsteps of their homes, sending the good wishes and blessings into the ether to join the spirit of Pallowen herself.</p><p>After midnight, the evening is said to belong to the unsavory and wicked forces of the world, both corporeal and spiritual. The custom of staying indoors after the sealing is most strictly adhered to in more rural parts of the world, but within more urban areas it can often mark when the evening’s revelry is just hitting its stride. However, even in remote villages, there are always young and adventurous folk who see it as a test of mettle or a rebellious shirking of superstition to sneak outdoors and experience what the night holds for them.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Festival Activities</strong></h2><p>The activities and games to be experienced during Pallowen can change depending on the country and region where it’s being celebrated, but there are a few typical festivities that accompany nearly every version of the festival.</p><p></p><h3>Harvest Hunt</h3><p>The harvest hunt happens in corn mazes, along labyrinthian woodland trails, or through obstacle courses constructed from tall stacks of straw bales. A favorite seasonal game of the exuberant and athletic, participants take on the role of either hunter or prey, racing through the maze to either corner their quarry or escape the hands of their pursuer.</p><p>The harvest hunt takes place over 6 rounds. Participants playing the role of hunter enter the harvest maze 1 round after the prey. Each round, each prey makes a DC 14 Intelligence check to find their way through the maze. If they are touched by a hunter, they are captured and cannot complete the maze. Hunters touch prey by making a melee attack roll against the prey’s unarmored AC. Prey survives the hunt once they have made 6 successful Intelligence checks without being touched by a hunter. The hunters win if no prey makes it completely through the maze.</p><p></p><h3>Masquerade</h3><p>The masquerade is a gorgeous and lively affair whether it takes place around a bonfire or in an elegant ballroom. Partygoers wear their most elaborate costumes—with more metropolitan guests even enchanting their garb with illusions—and dance and celebrate until moments before The Sealing begins, at which point the Lord of the Masquerade is chosen. Chosen by applause and general audience uproar, the new Lord is presented with a small hawthorn crown and hoisted on the shoulders of their new court before being carried back to their home.</p><p>Over the course of the masquerade, participants may make a DC 14 Charisma check to impress their fellow partygoers and gain their support. On a successful check, the participant gains the support of 5 partygoers, or 10 partygoers if the check succeeds by 5 or more. On a failed check, the participant gains no support or loses the support of 5 partygoers if the check fails by 5 or more. At the end of the masquerade, the participant who has gained the support of the most partygoers is crowned the Lord of the Masquerade. In the event of a tie, the winner is determined by a final contested Charisma check.</p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Masquerade.jpg\" width=\"222\" height=\"397\" /><p></p><h3>Pumpkin Toss</h3><p>A staple of rural celebrations, the pumpkin toss is a Pallowen test of strength where participants gather up carved gourds from their position around the community and attempt to throw them onto tall wooden stakes. Generally started long after the cider and ale have been flowing for hours, the toss is often more of a mirthful act of pumpkin destruction than a true test of skill.</p><p>Participants have 3 chances to land a pumpkin on one of 3 wooden stakes, each painted a different color and set 15 feet apart from one another. Landing a pumpkin on the red stake requires a successful DC 13 Strength check and nets the participant 2 points. Landing a pumpkin on the purple stake requires a successful DC 15 Strength check and nets the participant 4 points. Landing a pumpkin on the gold stake requires a successful DC 17 Strength check and nets the participant 7 points. After the participants have each completed 3 tosses, the one with the most points is declared the winner.</p><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/pumpkintoss.png\" /><h3>Stilt Fight</h3><p>A test of balance and coordination, the stilt fight pits two people on colorful, ribbon-wrapped stilts against one another over a pool filled with autumn leaves—or any other festive, cushiony material. Although attempts to dislodge one another from their perch can lead to spirited scuffles, this contest always ends in laughter and good-humored teasing among the contestants.</p><p>Participants roll initiative at the start of each round. The participant with the highest initiative can attempt to knock over their opponent by making a Strength (Athletics) check contested by their opponent’s Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If a participant is overcome by their opponent, they can save themselves by succeeding on a DC 14 Dexterity check. Each time a participant must save themselves, the DC for their Dexterity check increases by 2. Once a participant has knocked over their opponent, they are declared the winner.</p><p></p><h3>Warding Parade</h3><p>The warding parade is the heart and soul of Pallowen and the activity most looked forward to by children celebrating the holiday. Not only does it provide the perfect opportunity to show off the costumes that the villagers worked on for weeks, but according to tradition, it also wards away any lingering evil spirits that might try to hide in the community. The fact that it culminates in pulling treats from the Pallowen Basket makes it all the sweeter.</p><p>The below<strong> @UUID[RollTable.r50vB2XZ8L7mohdP]{Pallowen Basket Treats}</strong> table provides examples of what might be pulled from the basket at the end of the warding parade and what blessings might be attached to them.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Plot Hooks</strong></h2><p>The following are plot hooks that you can use to stir up some adventure on Pallowen.</p><p>• While traveling through a great swamp, the party realizes that midnight has passed on Pallowen, and the ominous feeling of being followed settles upon them. The rush to make it back to civilization now begins. On the outskirts of a small hamlet, the group is approached by a terrified young child who tells them that her mother is going to be sacrificed by the locals in an attempt to drive off Old Scarwood.</p><p>• During the Warding of Pallowen, the sound of snapping trees and piercing screams suddenly interrupts the festivities as several blighted and rotten treants amble into the town square.</p><p>• While walking down the street, an unseen force suddenly lifts a small food cart and throws it through a tavern window. Screams can be heard from the building as people spill into the street still dressed in their Pallowen costumes.</p><p>• Raina Pamerra, a local lord, has asked that a nearby dungeon be emptied out before midnight on Pallowen. She fears the evil within will devastate the countryside if left unchecked during this dangerous season.</p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/pallowen_card.png\" width=\"198\" height=\"278\" /><h1><strong>Guilds &amp; Orders: The Order of the Sentinals</strong></h1><p></p><blockquote><p>“All for the cause. All for the realm. All against the darkness.”</p><p>- Order of the Sentinels creed</p></blockquote><p></p><p>The Order of the Sentinels is an ancient and secret society dedicated to protecting mortals from the supernaturally evil threats that work to escape the confines of their planes and wreak havoc on the Prime Material Plane. These brave guardians risk their own lives and souls to ensure that nothing sinister crosses the Veil between the planes and that those creatures that make it through are tracked down and destroyed.</p><p></p><h1><strong>The Darken Veil</strong></h1><p>The Darken Veil is the wall between the Prime Material Plane and all planes and pocket planes dedicated to evil, insanity, and decay. It’s an extraordinary magical barrier said to have been built by the gods as an extra measure of protection upon the existing Planar Veil that creates the gulf between creatures of the Prime Material and the various planes around them. Crossing the Veil between planes is incredibly difficult, but piercing the Darken Veil is nearly impossible for the malevolent forces of the cosmology. However, this layer of protection can be breached by mortals attempting to reach through and contact the powerful dark beings on the other side. Those mortals who willingly peer through the Darken Veil do so at the risk of their sanity, lives, and spirits, but the exchange of power they may receive is too great for them to forego. Each time these individuals reach through the Darken Veil, whether just deep enough to scry or to directly call upon an extraplanar servant, they weaken the barrier and run the risk of something more powerful and dire than they could imagine slipping through.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Malefic Ripples</strong></h2><p>One of the primary tenets among the Order of the Sentinels is that every great tragedy, every terrible event created by the forces of evil, can be traced to a single facilitating moment. These moments of contact with the dark planes, or Malefic Ripples as they’re called by the Order, leave impressions on the Darken Veil that can be found by those trained to sense them. Sentinels spend their time investigating and tracking down the sources of these Malefic Ripples, seeking to eliminate any potentially world-altering schemes in their infancy. Budding necromancers touching the Necrotic Plane, gathering occultists tampering with dark artifacts, warlocks turning to the void, or summoners reaching out for fiendish minions, are all targets of the Order of the Sentinels’ justice.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Who Joins</strong></h2><p>The Order of the Sentinels welcomes people from all walks of life into their ranks, although they specifically seek out and recruit those who have been the victims of the supernatural tragedies and traumas they seek to prevent. After months of investigation and observation, a potential recruit will be approached by a standing member of the order and invited to join their fight against the forces of darkness in any way they can. The members of the Order of the Sentinels are bakers, farmers, warriors, midwives, scholars, and politicians, but above all else, they are enemies of what lies beyond the Darken Veil.</p><p><em><strong>You will thrive in the Order of the Sentinels if:</strong></em></p><p>• You do not trust extraplanar forces or those who use them.</p><p>• You would lay down your life to protect the realm.</p><p>• You are willing to provide whatever you can in service of the cause.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Divisions of the Order</strong></h2><p>The Order of the Sentinels is a society of individuals who share a common goal and general mindset. Members are unpaid, although any wealth or treasure taken by the group is divided evenly among the chapter who found it, with the most wealthy members abstaining in favor of those less fortunate. Sentinels always provide for each other in whatever ways they can, whether it be a place to stay for the night, provisions for a mission to come, or using their political connections to facilitate an objective. The Order of the Sentinels has four divisions spread throughout the realm who work together to keep watch on the world around them and maintain the secrecy of their order.</p><p></p><h3>Sentries</h3><p>Although this is the simplest position in the order, it’s also considered the most important. This division is filled with locals who have few skills and hold humble positions within their communities. Sentries make up the largest numbers in the Order and are the primary source of information distribution among the members. They go about their daily lives as normal, and when they spot any signs of Malefic Ripples in the area, they immediately report this to their assigned contact and continue to watch and wait.</p><p></p><h3>Endowers</h3><p>This division is responsible for supplying the members of the Order of the Sentinels with what they need for their quests and missions for the order. They are usually merchants, outfitters, and blacksmiths of varying types who are well supplied with money and resources.</p><p></p><h3>Seekers</h3><p>This is the most dangerous division in the order. These are the warriors and field investigators who seek out the sources of Malefic Ripples that have been reported. Seekers are willing to do whatever must be done to stop those powers that would cause devastation to society, and that can often lead them down dangerous and illegal paths. Seekers must be careful of not only the dark forces they’re hunting, but of the local law enforcement and officials of the areas they’re in.</p><p></p><h3>Torchbearers</h3><p>Torchbearers are the leaders of the order and generally hold positions of power in their communities. Elders, politicians, and sages are all typically found in this division, and it’s their responsibility to organize and coordinate their local chapter of the Order of the Sentinels. These are the people responsible for removing bureaucratic roadblocks hindering the Order’s members, assigning missions, and clearing up any legal troubles that the Seekers may cause.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Goals</strong></h2><p>The goals of the Order of the Sentinels have remained unchanged since its founding: seek out those who would pierce the Darken Veil and destroy them before they can destroy the innocent mortal lives around them, hunt down any evil creatures who have broken through, and never let the life of one individual outweigh the lives of all.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Guild Features</strong></h2><p>The following options are available to PCs who join the Order of the Sentinels.</p><p></p><h3>Order of the Sentinels (Advanced Background)</h3><p>After surviving a terrible supernatural calamity, you were sought out by a member of the @UUID[Item.EfCqy6gnMufT06JP]{Order of the Sentinels}and recruited. You have completed your esoteric training with the Order and can now spot evidence of intrusion on the Darken Veil.</p><p></p><h3>Feature: Trace the Ripples</h3><p>You can sense and @UUID[Item.4ONcEfmMAu7tZhlO]{locate Malefic Ripples} . You may use Intelligence (Arcana) checks to track and determine the approximate time and location that something attempted to cross or communicate with any evil-aligned plane for up to 1 day after the contact or crossing was attempted.</p><p></p><h3>The Sentinel’s Light</h3><p>Wondrous Item, Major, Uncommon</p><p>This gorgeously crafted lantern is owned by all members of the Order of the Sentinels and kept carefully hidden away unless needed. To the uninitiated, The @UUID[Item.xRZodD4IEItqbZJl]{The Sentinel's Light} looks like a well-made and ornate adventurer’s lantern, but this mystical item is the most important tool in the Order’s arsenal.</p><p>The Sentinel’s Light has 3 charges, and regains all expended charges daily at sunrise. You may spend 1 charge to cast one of the spells below:</p><p>• <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.BP3GCwa66IAw1yTG]{Daylight}</em></p><p>• <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Mzh95utKDPIrjiH8]{Detect Evil and Good}</em></p><p>• <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.xmDBqZhRVrtLP8h2]{Protection from Evil and Good}</em></p><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Sentinels_Light.png\" width=\"184\" height=\"298\" /><p></p><h1><strong>Cults and Syndicates: The Broken Bone</strong></h1><p></p><blockquote><p>“He is the Ivory Chain! He is the Grinning Master! He is the Deathless Destruction! And we shall make him great again.”</p><p>— Lysba Valkin, cleric of Ecrassus</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Dominance, of not only a body but of a spirit. Control, of not only a life but of the death that comes after. That is what Ecrassus requires from his followers. That is what drives the cult of the Broken Bone.</p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Cults_Syndicates.jpg\" /><p></p><h2><strong>Break the Bones</strong></h2><p>Members of the Broken Bone live their lives in service of Ecrassus, God of the Skeletal Throng. Before he fell from power, Ecrassus ruled over a vast roaming army of skeletal undead that endlessly traversed the Necrotic Plane. A brutal and merciless god-king, Ecrassus commanded his followers to kill, conquer, and subjugate in the worst ways possible, and the worshippers of this fallen deity work to continue his legacy of violence and tyranny from their scattered factions around the continent.</p><p>The Broken Bone exists in small, generally uncoordinated pockets on the fringes of society, among evil tribes of barbarians, or in countries where the opportunity to practice necromancy or slavery without repercussion is available. Although anyone may be mad enough to be taken in by this abysmal sect, the most common followers are those who enjoy the power and dominance championed by this cult or those who have been victims of the same for long enough to become broken and evil themselves. The most common leaders of these cells are clerics, inspired by the nearly forgotten doctrine of Ecrassus and gifted visions from beyond the veil, or necromancers who see themselves in command of their own ivory horde one day. Despite their lack of formal organization, no matter where this cult begins to grow or who is leading them, their methods are fairly predictable, falling in line with the tenets of their malevolent god. And Ecrassus’s demands are as simple as they are immutable; to break the weak and claim all they have to offer. Or, as his followers often chant,</p><p><em><strong>“Break the bones, reap the marrow.”</strong></em></p><p></p><h2><strong>Reap the Marrow</strong></h2><p>Once they have their foothold in an area, the cult will begin scouting out areas to raid. Small villages and farms are particularly vulnerable at this stage, as they typically have the smallest means of resistance and offer the quickest way for the Broken Bone to swell their ranks. After successfully overtaking a village, they will enslave any survivors and begin their darkest works. The cult of the Broken Bone believes that in order to create a true skeletal throng, one that will return their master to his former glory, they cannot simply kill and then raise the remains of their victims. Instead, they combine their necromantic rites with forced labor, ritualistically working their new slaves to death, breaking both their bodies and spirits before adding their skeletons to their burgeoning army.</p><p>The cult will repeat this grisly cycle for as long as they can, attacking larger and larger settlements and growing their numbers until they draw the ire of a contingent strong enough to put an end to their reign of terror, or Ecrassus provides their leader with some new malignant directive.</p><p></p><section id=\"secret-zFKbkwVANK9Elox6\" class=\"secret\"><p><em><strong>GM NOTE:</strong></em></p><p><strong>For altercations with members of the cult of the Broken Bone, utilizing the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.CHEUjiYrVM9X0vIT]{Acolyte}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.B7lBOr1AahNZs4a6]{Archmage}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.kz1t6xeXVwODpYb2]{Berserker}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.tYfQIxCJT0WaaKmc]{Cult Fanatic}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.mQnsXanewsPiV7QE]{Mage}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.PVD5wRdyO7iCJPs1]{Priest}, or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.nREPw9g94Bsb9sIl]{Tribal Warrior} stat blocks would all be appropriate, depending on the flavor and difficulty of the encounter you're running.

An elaborate headdress made of melded bones, this grim artifact is coveted by his followers and provides them with all of the necrotic abilities they need to spread his sinister dogma.</p><p><strong>Random Properties.</strong> The Crown of Bone has the following random properties:</p><p>• 2 @UUID[RollTable.XSMUSA2l1oUbiZ6n]{major beneficial properties}</p><p>• 1 @UUID[RollTable.zY9TGvasG2D15znC]{major detrimental properties}</p><p><strong>Master of Skeletons.</strong> While you are attuned to the Crown of Bone, you can use an action to attempt to dominate any skeletal creatures that are not currently under your control.

On a failed save, the creatures must obey your commands for the next 24 hours.</p><p><strong>Mighty Throng.</strong> While you are attuned to the Crown of Bone, when you cast the animate dead spell, you may choose bones from any Small, Medium, or Large creature as the target of your spell. Additionally, when you cast animate dead, you may create twice as many skeletons as you normally could with that spell slot.</p><p><strong>Persistent Subjugation.</strong> When you gain control of a skeletal undead through any means, you may double the duration of your control.</p><p><strong>Destroying the Crown.</strong> If the creature attuned to the Crown of Bone has its hit points reduced to zero by radiant damage from a creature with good in its alignment, the Crown of Bone is sent back to the Necrotic Plane, and all undead under their control are immediately destroyed. The Crown of Bone can only be truly destroyed by the willing sacrifice of a Celestial or through divine intervention.</p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/crown%20of%20bone.png\" width=\"220\" height=\"441\" /><p></p><h3><strong>Plot Hooks</strong></h3><p>The following are plot hooks you can use to introduce your players to the cult of the Broken Bone.</p><p>• The eldest daughter of Malcus Valkin has been missing for three months. His search parties have all come up empty-handed. With rumors of raiders growing in the area, and his desperation peaking, the wealthy merchant is willing to offer a fortune to any brave souls who can find her.</p><p>• News has come that Delk’s Peak has been completely overrun by savage barbarians. The few survivors who have managed to escape are telling tales of people being led away in chains and skeletal warriors running rampant.</p><p>• The people at the tavern are all abuzz about the madman who wandered into town overnight. He’s currently sitting in the local jail, ranting about the coming of “the ivory chain” and drawing incoherent scribbles in the dirt.</p><p>• A young acolyte of a local church has been having visions of an approaching skeletal army. No one has given their dreams much thought, but now that rumors of undead lurking in nearby ruins have reached the ears of the Bishop, she’s looking for a group to investigate.</p><p>• After a successful skirmish with a group of orcs, searching their bodies reveals a strange symbol made of human bone and a crudely drawn map to an apparent gathering place.</p><p></p><h1><strong>Infested: Parasites For Your Game</strong></h1><p></p><blockquote><p>“There are thousands of ways to die, millions if you’re really creative. I would take any of them over what did that.”</p><p>- Kinsey Stafford, Apprentice Field Medic</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Adventurers seem to have a habit of going to great lengths to put themselves where they don’t belong. Traversing far-off mountains, exploring dense jungles, or crossing shifting deserts means risking many dangers—both seen and unseen. And before any inexperienced party heads off into the great unknown, they’re often given words of warning and wisdom from their more experienced peers. Told in no uncertain terms that there are ravenous beasts, evil hordes, and supernatural monsters waiting to pounce in the wild places where adventurers are driven to explore, a fresh-faced group might feel emboldened by the knowledge that’s passed their way. But although knowing how to spot and avoid a massive danger will surely prolong the life of a traveling hero, sometimes the gravest threats these areas contain come in the smallest packages.</p><p></p><section id=\"secret-hGnQumUdo4m6MONS\" class=\"secret\"><p><em><strong>GM NOTE, Content Warning:</strong></em></p><p>This new game option introduces an element that some players may find too disturbing to enjoy. Beyond the painful and often grotesque physical symptoms that accompany parasites, these tiny scourges can also bring about feelings of invasion and violation that characters must overcome.</p><p>Whereas some players may find this to be an enjoyable (if somewhat disgusting) obstacle for their character to face, others might find that exploring these particular themes in any way ruins the fun of their game and potential story arc for their character. As with all new rules and game options, it is highly recommended that potentially including parasites in your game is discussed during your pre-campaign conversations or during your group’s session zero.</p></section><p></p><h2><strong>Parasite Mechanics</strong></h2><p>Beyond adding a layer of revulsion and paranoia, parasites bring a new condition into the game—infested. Unless otherwise stated in a parasite’s description block, any spell or effect that detects disease or poison or ends disease or the poisoned condition will detect parasites or end the infested condition as well.</p><p>The effects of being infested are as follows:</p><p></p><h3>Infested</h3><p>• An infested creature has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws and Wisdom (Perception) checks.</p><p></p><h3>Effects</h3><p>In addition to the infested condition, most parasites cause unique effects that are detailed in their description block. The Effect section of a parasite’s block describes the duration, damage, and any other ramifications that an infestation from that parasite may cause.</p><p></p><h3>Becoming Infested</h3><p>Each parasite’s description block indicates how a creature becomes infested with that particular parasite by specifying whether it is external or internal. External parasites are typically contracted by passing through and coming into physical contact with an affected area or object. Internal parasites are generally contracted by a creature introducing the parasite into its system by drinking or eating contaminated materials or receiving an injury from some infested creatures.</p><p></p><h3>Detecting Parasites</h3><p>Parasites, like diseases and poisons, cannot be detected by nonmagical means, although a discerning character could make an appropriate skill check (Arcana, Nature, Medicine, or Survival) to realize the symptoms in another creature and tie them to the parasite in question. The DC for such checks should be determined by the GM as is appropriate to the circumstance.</p><p></p><h3>Harvesting</h3><p>Particularly adventurous characters may attempt to harvest parasites for later use. Should a character detect or discover a source of parasites, via magical or nonmagical means, they can follow the standard rules for harvesting poison to do so. Should they succeed in their necessary skill checks as determined by the GM, they can harvest one use of the parasite. If they fail, they are infested and subjected to the parasite’s effects as normal.</p><p></p><h3>Treatment</h3><p>Outside of spells or features that remove the infested condition from a creature, the most common way to remove parasites is through the use of an antiparasitic. Any character who has proficiency with an Herbalism Kit may create a single dose of a basic antiparasitic over the course of two hours if they have the necessary materials available.</p><p>It should be noted that anything that ends the infested condition on a creature will also end the effects of the parasite affecting them.</p><p></p><h3>Antiparasitic</h3><p>Adventuring Gear</p><p>30 gp</p><p>This @UUID[Item.7mapJQJk84QyOKfL]{potent tincture} provides a creature with advantage on saving throws against infestation for 1 hour or ends the infested condition in a currently affected creature.</p><p></p><p>Some parasites are more exotic, virulent, or magical than others and require one or more special materials in order to make an effective antiparasitic to prevent or treat their infestation. If special materials are necessary, they will be listed in the parasite’s description block.</p><p></p><h2><strong>New Parasites</strong></h2><p>The following are new parasites that you can introduce into your games. GMs should feel free to use the below as templates for creating their own parasites for later use, or to alter the saving throw DCs, durations, or descriptions of those provided to better fit their campaigns.</p><p></p><h3>Dream Eaters (Internal)</h3><p>Dream eaters are leech-like creatures that inhabit the sands of deserts and beaches. They spend most of their lives in hibernation among the dunes, only waking when they sense the presence of a warm-blooded creature in their vicinity. Those unfortunate enough to make camp among the dream eaters stir these parasites from their slumber, causing the worms to slowly climb from the sands and make their way up and into their victim’s ear canal. By the next morning, the throbbing pain in the affected creature’s ears, combined with the constant scritching of the dream eater’s movements, makes sleep and concentration nearly impossible.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Effect:</strong></p><p><strong>Dream eaters cause incessant pain and irritation in the ears of those they afflict. A creature subjected to this parasite must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.</strong></p><p><strong>On a successful save, the creature is infested for 2d12 hours.</strong></p><p><strong>On a failed save, the infestation lasts 2d4 days.</strong></p><p><strong>While infested, the creature has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration and cannot complete a long rest.</strong></p></blockquote><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Parasite1.png\" width=\"231\" height=\"328\" /><h3>Gorgon’s Kiss (Internal)</h3><p>Gorgon’s kiss are minute parasites that dwell on flowers and other vibrant flora, nesting among the pollen that the plants produce. As the wind carries the infested particles through the air, they’re inhaled by unlucky creatures passing through the clouds of spores, at which point the parasites begin their assault on their hosts’ bodies. As gorgon’s kiss moves through the infested creature, feasting on the blood flowing through their bodies, they excrete a substance that crystallizes and hardens, causing increasing amounts of pain and lethargy in their host. Allowed to go unchecked, the victims of gorgon’s kiss are left completely petrified by the crystals throughout their body.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Effect:</strong></p><p><strong>Gorgon’s kiss causes lethargy, pain, and eventual petrification in those they infest. A creature that contracts this parasite must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw.</strong></p><p><strong>On a failed save, it is infested and immediately gains 1 level of exhaustion. Exhaustion gained by gorgon’s kiss cannot be removed while the afflicted creature is infested.</strong></p><p><strong>Every 4 hours, the infested creature must repeat its saving throw.</strong></p><p><strong>On a failure, it takes 2d6 slashing damage. While infested, if the afflicted creature fails 3 saving throws, they become restrained. After failing 6 total saving throws, the infested creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.</strong></p></blockquote><p></p><h3>Hermit Hounds (Internal)</h3><p>Hermit hounds are thin, translucent worms that are found infesting the waters and wildlife of forested areas. Incredibly difficult to see, they’re most commonly encountered by novice adventurers and careless woodsmen who improperly prepare game or drink water tainted with the parasite. After infestation, hermit hounds cause a noticeable change in the personality of their host, making them prone to irritation and paranoia and driving them to become more and more isolated. Once driven into seclusion in the wilderness, the host most typically falls victim to another wild animal or creature that the hermit hounds then pass on to.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Effect:</strong></p><p><strong>Hermit hounds cloud the mind and dull their host’s personality. A creature that drinks water or eats food contaminated with this parasite must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw.</strong></p><p><strong>On a failed save, the creature is infested for 1d10 days and has disadvantage on all Charisma saving throws and ability checks, avoiding the effects on a success.</strong></p></blockquote><p></p><img src=\"modules/under-the-harvest-moons/Assets/Art/Parasite2.png\" width=\"232\" height=\"171\" /><p></p><h3>Storm Mites (External)</h3><p>Storm mites are aquatic arthropods roughly the size and shape of a copper piece. In most circumstances, these creatures remain in the shallow tidal pools where they’re born without ever coming into contact with people. However, during periods of monsoons and flooding, minuscule storm mite larvae are swept inland where they burrow under the skin of anyone they touch, creating excruciating clusters of boils and making it almost impossible to wear anything heavier than a loose tunic. After incubating within their host, the mature mites burst out of their host’s flesh, causing even more pain and trauma to their victim’s body.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Effect:</strong></p><p><strong>Storm mites burrow into the skin, causing painful and grotesque boils where they gather. A creature that comes into contact with this parasite must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.</strong></p><p><strong>On a failed save, the creature is infested for 1d6 days while the mites incubate. During this period, the pustules caused by the incubating mites make wearing light, medium, or heavy armor impossible. At the end of their incubation period, the mites burst from their host's skin, causing 3d4 piercing damage.</strong></p></blockquote><p></p><h3>Wraith Kin (External)</h3><p>Wraith kin are tiny, transparent jellies that dwell in caves and dank dungeons throughout the realms. They wait on floors, walls, and ceilings in a dormant state until a living creature passes near them, rousing them from their slumber, at which point they attach themselves to their host's flesh. The impact of the wraith kin can be noticed immediately on their host, who finds themself suddenly depleted of their vitality and life force. Given their near-invisible bodies and the draining effects they have on those they infest, they are rumored to be a type of undead, though this is yet to be proven.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Effect:</strong></p><p><strong>Wraith kin attach to their host’s flesh, leeching their energy and spirit. A creature whose flesh comes into contact with wraith kin must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.</strong></p><p><strong>On a failed save, the creature becomes infested for 2d6 days, or avoiding the effect on a success.</strong></p><p><strong>While infested, the creature’s hit point maximum is reduced by 4d4.</strong></p></blockquote><p></p><h2><strong>Infesting Spells</strong></h2><p>The following are new infesting spells characters can use to pass along the unwelcome pains of parasites or GMs can use to fill in the spellbooks of their insidious NPCs.</p><p></p><blockquote><p>@UUID[Item.EWGZKXbWNAZejaje]{Infesting Grasp}</p><p>1st-level conjuration</p><p>Casting Time: 1 action</p><p>Range: Touch</p><p>Components: V, S</p><p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>You reach out and clutch a target creature, summoning the virulent might of nature’s tiniest terrors.
